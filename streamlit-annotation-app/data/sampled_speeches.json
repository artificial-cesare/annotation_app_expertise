That's the premise on which we make these recommendations, and it is simply to recognise that you need to pay more money on a regular basis to be able to bring that revenue up. We have targeted four main areas by including a one percent increase on the existing tax infrastructure. We recognise that there are people who have very low incomes who make a huge tax take on things like sales and duties, so we have left them clear. We have not messed about with the personal income tax, because as progressive as it is, those that get more, pay more, we recognise that there is no point in hitting those that don't earn a lot and pay more. So, what we are proposing is that resources, and we now know, having confirmed that earlier, that the mining industry, the coal and the oil industry, the gas industry and other mining type businesses, including farming to some extent, peat, has an environmental impact. We want to propose adding one percent per annum to their tax bill.",

If you think of the shale hills from the mining that we're still having to deal with. Or if you look at Hunterston, which is a relatively green thing, we're going to spend the next 100 years cleaning it up. So, there will be costs attached to that.",

What would you be proposing by way of tax increases, tax decreases or changing and moving taxes around? So, rather than let’s all dive in and grab things and move around, have a think about what you would propose. Write it down on a piece of paper and have a chat to the person beside you and check it out with them, because they might laugh at you, or they might support you and it gives you an idea, you know, it's somebody to bounce your idea off before you then share it with the table, and because there’s eight of us, we need a simple majority around the table, when you propose your idea, if five or more people say, yes, I support that, then it passes, and we say it passes.

IT IS STILL THE EXPERIENCE OF HIGH-QUALITY FEMALE ENTREPRENEURS THAT, TO SCALE THEIR BUSINESS TO EXIT, THEY HAVE TO NAVIGATE A WORLD OF MEN.

        "KIRITH ENTWISTLE: My first question is for you, Dr Marks. In your evidence, you challenged the assumption that more women starting businesses is automatically better. Could you tell us a little about some of your concerns around encouraging more women into entrepreneurship?",
        "DR MARKS: Absolutely. It is important to say that I am not against women entrepreneurs per se, but I suppose that my research and the evidence that I have presented to the Committee looks at some of the other aspects of women entrepreneurs’ lives and experiences. One of the things that my evidence shows is that women find it very difficult to make sustaining incomes for themselves from running their own business to the extent that it is quite doubtful that most women starting a business are going to be able to replicate the kind of income they might get in the market in employment. Therefore, it would be great if the taskforce is thinking about the overall impact that encouraging women into entrepreneurship might have on questions like women’s financial equality and long-term financial futures, as well as just simply things like the gender pay gap.",
        "KIRITH ENTWISTLE: We have talked a lot about the gender pay gap, and I imagine that is one of the elements that you mean. For the wider panel as well: to what extent do discussions on supporting female entrepreneurs focus too much on start-ups and not enough on the growth and sustainability element that Dr Marks mentioned there?",
        "DR TREANOR: That is really a very good question, and probably an accurate observation because when the prevailing discourse is around women’s under-representation as entrepreneurs, it naturally then leads the discussions and thinking about how we get more women into entrepreneurship, which is obviously very quantity focused, and perhaps does not pay due regard to the quality aspect, as a natural outworking of that. What we really need to also consider, and something that my research would suggest, is that there is a very big difference between the quality of entrepreneurship and being able to make a good living and a good return to the economy. The UK has quite a high rate of people living in self-employed poverty, so when we are encouraging people into entrepreneurship where they have the potential to generate a suitable living return, it is important to consider that we do it responsibly and mindfully. But there needs to be a better balance because we really need to focus on how those women who are in business can then be encouraged and supported to have sustainable businesses they can grow, which we know is a challenge.",
        "PROFESSOR STEPHAN: I would concur with that; we need to focus on all three elements—start-up, sustainability and growth—which all have their own challenges. It is really good that we are talking about growth, but when we talk about start-ups I feel we are not necessarily talking about sustaining entrepreneurship and making it work for women. I would completely concur that for a developed economy, the UK seems to have a lot of necessity entrepreneurship, especially women’s necessity entrepreneurship. We see from analysis of the UK household data that women who leave their jobs to start a business, which is normally considered opportunity entrepreneurship, do not get the same uplift in wellbeing as men, so it does not seem to be a positive choice. So, all the rhetoric around it being a fulfilling career and being able to design your own job and organisation, which seems very attractive, does not seem to bear out. We are not talking enough about this in terms of specific managerial capacity. You need to do everything as an entrepreneur, and it is really challenging. There is a huge psychological barrier to taking on the first employee, which is also something we are not necessarily looking at enough because once you become more than a one-woman business, you can then focus more on strategy, including growth, for instance, but then you also have additional responsibilities to manage, which is not so easy, and there is a risk discussion in that as well. I will stop there."

In fact, the Salisbury convention came about, as you know, after the 1945 Labour victory. Similarly, the 1999 reforms came about again after an election victory.

You try to agree policy on the proposal. Sometimes you can do those things by write-around, if it is not very controversial. Major things, where you want proper, serious discussion around the table, will be taken to a Cabinet committee, which should make the decision.",

        "BARONESS FINN: Thank you, and good morning. This question is about constitutional issues and how they are considered during the policy and decision-making processes. The distinction there is that, while constitutional matters are clearly considered when the policy involves a change to the constitution, they can be more overlooked or a bit more ad hoc in the development of other policy. Would you describe as fair that the way in which constitutional concerns are raised is ad hoc? Does the consideration of the constitution need to be more formally embedded into the policy and decision-making process?",
        "PAT MC FADDEN MP: I will bring in Minister Thomas-Symonds on this. If you pose the question that ad hoc sounds bad and more formal sounds good, you will always get to one answer. Again, in the British system these things are a product of our history. Awareness is important. It is easy to call for. There is a phrase I have heard in Whitehall that people use almost as an internal self-criticism: devolve and forget. I do not think we should devolve and forget, because there has to be a live and ongoing relationship. There are probably Ministers over the course of history in both parties who have not always fully had their mind on that. That is something we have to guard against, because it is a really important relationship. I will bring in Nick.",
        "NICK THOMAS-SYMONDS MP: In relation to what you have said, Baroness Finn, there are clearly formal processes that exist. There is the Union and Constitution Cabinet committee, which the Chancellor of the Duchy has already referred to. In addition, there is the Parliamentary Business and Legislation Committee—or the PBL, as we call it.",
        "LORD STRATHCLYDE: Around the table for that committee, you will obviously find the territorial Secretaries of State for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. I am there too. The memberships of those committees are public knowledge. They can be viewed. I am there in my role as Minister for the Constitution, so that is very much there. There is the general collective decision-making process of government, which obviously includes advice from the law officers as well. There is an apparatus in the system specifically to raise constitutional matters and concerns. I think Baroness Drake was drawing that distinction in an earlier question. There is a distinction between a constitutional reform agenda and what I would call constitutional stewardship. Constitutional stewardship is very much part of what you would be discussing at those committees: the implications for our existing constitutional arrangements, as well as a wider constitutional reform agenda. That formality is embedded in the system. As the Chancellor of the Duchy said, it is very much the case that the constitution has to be part of a mindset across policy-making, as well as informally when Ministers see or are engaged with particular issues that have constitutional implications. That softer side—the informal side—is hugely important, as well as the formal processes that exist.",
        "BARONESS FINN: Thank you. I raise it and am slightly pushing on it because Alex Thomas, who was principal private secretary to Jeremy Heywood when he was Cabinet Secretary, was very clear about the importance of the role of the Cabinet Secretary because things were raised to the Cabinet Secretary in bringing those issues to the Prime Minister. Often, they tend to emerge because a Minister or a law officer has a concern, and it is outside the frameworks that are being discussed. That is not necessarily a bad thing.",
        "NICK THOMAS-SYMONDS MP: What that also highlights, when we are talking about constitutional responsibilities—I was answering on the basis of the ministerial level—is that it is obviously the case that the Cabinet Secretary has a hugely important position in all this, both in the role of Cabinet Secretary and head of the home Civil Service. You are entirely right to highlight the crucial nature of that role in terms of constitutional implications.",

        "LORD STRATHCLYDE: First, thank you all very much for coming along. It is really helpful to have all of you here today. This is about strategic thinking, but it is also about policy development. The question I am really after, which I do not think will surprise you, is that one of the Bills coming forward this year is of course on parliamentary reform. It is deeply constitutional because it affects the Chamber of the House of Lords. There does not seem to have been any great discussion about it, or the cross-party consensus building or working through various cross-party organisations that would have been possible. It looks and feels—I am talking particularly about the House of Lords reform Bill—particularly partisan, since 95% of the people due to be expelled from the House of Lords are not supporters of the Labour Party. Do you think there is any credibility in that? Do you think it is all right for a new Government simply to come in and get rid of its opponents in one of the Houses?",
        "PAT MC FADDEN MP: I will let Minister Thomas-Symonds deal with the bulk of this. The only thing I would say is that I think it is okay for a party to enact its manifesto if it wins an election. I leave the rest to Minister Thomas-Symonds.",
        "NICK THOMAS-SYMONDS MP: To pick it up, Lord Strathclyde, in terms of the House of Lords Reform Bill that I think will be before your Lordships next month, that is clearly in our manifesto as an immediate first step. It is there as a step on its own. I would argue, first, that it is in the manifesto and, secondly, it is within the Salisbury convention as well, and that is how it was intended. To the point about hereditary Peers, no, it does not have the motivation that you suggest, nor is it in any way personal. I have worked in various roles. I have had both shadow roles, and indeed in government, with hereditary Peers. It is not personal in any sense. I have found them extremely good to work with. It is to do with a principle. It is a principle that places in our legislature should not be reserved on the basis of an accident of birth. It is about a principle and nothing to do with personalities or indeed wider partisanship. To your second point about trying to build consensus on reform, that is precisely why there is a staged approach in the manifesto. The manifesto sets out a number of steps, the end destination of which is described as an alternative second Chamber that is more representative of the nations and the regions. There is also a series of steps in there around the second stage of the reform looking at things like participation requirements, for example. Of course, it would be great if we could build consensus around that second stage. It is something that, as a student of history, seems to me to have eluded previous attempts at reform. It has not reached that happy state of agreement across parties or, indeed, across Houses. I suggest that the first step is clearly within the manifesto, and I would argue that there is an electoral mandate for it.",
        "LORD STRATHCLYDE: I completely understand the manifesto point, but do you think, therefore, that it is all right to change fundamentally the constitution simply on a manifesto pledge? There must be some other hurdle on it. Would that not be right?"

In using that legislation, there are two factors that need to be in play. First, you need a long-term stewardship body with credibility and good governance. Secondly, you need to be able to provide clear, meaningful timescales. A development corporation needs a lifespan of at least 40 years; if you are not interested in multi-decade placemaking, do not get into the game.\n\nIt is interesting. The outcome of the mark 1 to 3 new towns was that the legislation did not contain a clear sense of how stewardship would work. Milton Keynes and one or two other examples aside, in general, the premature winding up of the development corporations in 1980 and the fire sale of their assets broke the model of stewardship. There are some really bad, desperate examples—Peterlee perhaps being the best one—where assets were sold off very cheaply; now there are liabilities in green infrastructure, but there is no financial model for successfully managing it.\n\nThe critical intervention point is to amend the requirements on development corporations in the 1980 Act to prescribe the kind of stewardship body that the development corporation should then be evolved into and the kinds of objectives it should have. The development corporation winds up and that stewardship body should begin its work early, when the development corporation is still relatively young and then, ultimately, be clear about what assets it is trying to manage and, particularly and finally, what its relationship with the local authority is. That is the critical issue after that.\n\nLetchworth is the gold-plated model of how to do it, damaged though it is by three bits of legislation, but it still remains a very powerful model.

        "PROFESSOR LAURA MC ALLISTER: Yes, certainly. I made the point about delegated legislation for the very reason you expressed there: that it is often some of the most meaningful and impactful changes to citizens’ lives that come through delegated legislation. Therefore, we understood the frustrations of what Ministers were telling us when the Sewel convention had not protected their involvement and consent in those areas. I take your point about Henry VIII powers. If Henry VIII powers are used, there has to be an agreement by all Governments for that to happen. If there is not an agreement by all Governments, they should not be utilised. I am afraid I am speaking more in my own capacity than as a commission co-chair here, because we did not delve into that area in any great depth, but the intent behind our recommendation about putting Sewel on a statutory footing was very much framed by all the different aspects where legislation had not gained the consent of the devolved Governments, including delegated legislation.",
        "LORD BURNETT OF MALDON: Obviously, putting it on a statutory footing has all sorts of implications, the beginnings of which were explored in your dialogue with Lord Falconer. I take it that you would support the extension of the Sewel convention to delegated legislation and Henry VIII powers, even if the step was not taken to legislate, to put it into statute?",
        "PROFESSOR LAURA MC ALLISTER: Yes.",
        "DR ROWAN WILLIAMS: This is why it is a first step, which would certainly take us somewhere on the route.",
        "PROFESSOR LAURA MC ALLISTER: Yes.",
        "CHAIR: Could you just develop that point about extending the Sewel convention to delegated legislation? Some delegated legislation will not be a great moment. How could you distinguish so that you had a proportionate extension of Sewel delegated legislation? I am thinking of every piece of delegated legislation going through a consultation and am pushing you on how that mechanism could work. If one was to put the case for extending, you would not normally do it without consultation.",
        "DR ROWAN WILLIAMS: I wonder whether there would be a sort of default convention, so to speak, whereby you would have to make the case for certain pieces of delegated legislation being, as it were, taken for granted as not requiring the full procedure. I do not know. I am thinking on my feet here.",
        "PROFESSOR LAURA MC ALLISTER: The only thing I would add, again speculatively, is that if there was a better programme of legislation which the devolved Governments were consulted on early in the process, maybe there could be some distinction between the areas that would be of import to devolved Governments and those that are of less consequence to them. I am not sure how realistic that is in terms of how it might operate.",
        "LORD FALCONER OF THOROTON: Some Bills would be of huge interest to the Welsh Government where, putting it brutally, the UK Government would have a huge interest in overriding their interest. The EU Withdrawal Act is one. The Internal Market Act is another. What sort of process would you envisage for a Bill like that where, for quite legitimate reasons, you wanted the Government to do particular things? I do not favour the Government’s position in relation to that, but one has to accept politics. What would be the process for the sorts of Bills that you would have in mind?",
        "PROFESSOR LAURA MC ALLISTER: That is a difficult one. There would have to be an analysis of the areas where the changes that were being initiated through the Internal Market Act had a direct impact on devolved areas. If you take something like agriculture as an illustration, there is a financial and a political dimension to agriculture that is partly devolved, but when it comes to trade it might not be devolved. The only suggestion I could come up with would be to have had some analysis of the areas where there is a distinct jagged edge between the reserved and the devolved implications of a piece of legislation.",
        "DR ROWAN WILLIAMS: Yes. That is the point I would be tempted to make. It would be incumbent on somebody to make the case that this properly belonged to reserved issues in a devolution settlement.",
        "BARONESS ANDREWS: There is a sort of process in the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee, and although sometimes it picks out specific examples of how things will impact on the devolved Administration, it is not always consistent at that point. Sorry, I am making a statement without asking a question. Do you think it is worth the committee structure of the Senedd looking at how it might cooperate or get more automatic intelligence from the way the DPRRC is approaching legislation? When we considered the Internal Market Act in this House, we on the Common Frameworks Scrutiny Committee worked very closely on it, because we knew what the impact was going to be, and we worked with the relevant Ministers in Wales to help to advise on the floor of the House. The DPRRC is the only committee of the House which does anything like this and, if it were in scope, it would be an interesting avenue to explore.",
        "DR ROWAN WILLIAMS: That is really fleshing out some of what Laura was saying: at what point do those interests get flagged on the floor of these Houses?",
        "PROFESSOR LAURA MC ALLISTER: Does it not also underline how poor inter-parliamentary relations are? I know that your previous report in this area highlighted that very well. However, we must not focus entirely on intergovernmental relations, because the inter-parliamentary relations can be as critical to effective scrutiny and preventing some of the problems that occur further down the legislative process.",
        "BARONESS ANDREWS: Indeed. It might be worth thinking about scrutiny as a particular area to explore, not least because the DPRRC comes into the process late. We do not get its reports before committee and, in fact, what you want to do is scrutinise the process before anything approaches Second Reading.",
        "PROFESSOR LAURA MC ALLISTER: Exactly. By the way, that is easily and convincingly the strongest argument for enlarging the Senedd, which is to create an environment where scrutiny is possible. I have had 20 years of research in the Senedd and I can categorically say that, with 60 members, it is impossible to scrutinise the scope of legislation and financial spend effectively. Comparative evidence internationally will tell you exactly the same thing; it is uniquely the strongest argument for creating a Senedd of 96 members.",
        "CHAIR: I am terribly conscious that we are very shortly convening as a House, and people have all sorts of business. We have one more question, but we will not do justice to it if I just rush it through. It is this issue between the territorial Ministers and the Ministers in departments with functional remit. We are taking evidence from a panel of the three territorial Ministers, and it is quite an important issue that we want to interrogate. Professor Mc Allister, I am conscious your knowledge and academic situation will go beyond the commission, so would it be all right if we wrote the question to you? It is not a complex one.",

        "ALAN BROWN: We need to move on. Very quickly, Mr. Henig, how far is the possible scope of changes to the TCA constrained by the EU’s red lines? Can the UK cherry-pick particular aspects of the single market rather than the whole package?",
        "DAVID HENIG: Any negotiation is constrained by the red lines, and we will have our own red lines, but there is a lot that can be done. As I say, I was working with a Cross-Bench group of MPs and businesses in the UK Trade and Business Commission. We came up with over 100 recommendations, many of which were with the EU, for things that can practically be done that are not cherry picking. I fear that John Springford may say that many of them would not make a huge difference economically, but there are things that can be done for businesses in all of your constituencies that will make a difference at least to them, if not fundamentally to the big picture of UK exports. There are many things in this trade relationship that are worth doing and that we can do, short of challenging those red lines or fundamentally changing our relationship with the EU.",
        "MARK PAWSEY: I wonder if I could follow that up. What is the economic benefit of this—it is not a renegotiation—review? What could we get out of it, potentially? I will ask each of our witnesses. Catherine, you were pretty negative about the extent to which businesses in this country have in their DNA the idea of overseas trading. Is there any part of this review that is really going to make a difference to our economy?",
        "CATHERINE Mc BRIDE: It probably will not make a difference to our economy as a whole, but it will be important for individual businesses. Capitalism relies on new businesses coming up, so we have to foster that. Any tweaking where you can lower red tape for small businesses is good. John talked earlier about the OBR’s prediction. That prediction is based on an assumption that there has been lower investment in the UK due to Brexit uncertainty.",
        "MARK PAWSEY: I would not suggest that you go back into a serious big negotiation and create more Brexit uncertainty. One thing that has happened in the last few years is that everyone has calmed down and people have seen that there was no major problem. We continued to trade; they continued to buy our goods; we continued to buy their goods. When they needed gas, we found a way to get it to them. When we needed electricity, they supplied us. Everything is getting back to normal. I would definitely recommend tweaking it. The obvious areas are fisheries and Ireland. We really have to sort that out. Some areas of our services trade, such as business services, telecommunications and intellectual property, have grown more to the EU since we left than to non-EU. Other things like financial services have grown less than to non-EU. If you look at it over the long term, our financial services trade with the EU has been quite flat for the last six or seven years, whereas it has grown by 33% to non-EU countries. It is not so much that Brexit is hurting trade with the EU. It is just that the rest of the world is expanding at such a massive rate. It is very hard to compare them like for like. Mr. Springford, put those changes to one side. Just in terms of the changes to the agreement, could the tweaks that Catherine has spoken about have any significant impact on GDP?",
        "JOHN SPRINGFORD: I agree with Catherine. It will not have a significant impact on GDP. There is more progress in terms of reducing the barriers imposed between the UK and EU in the sectors covered by the agreements and that therefore leading to greater trade intensity, which is important, and higher GDP, simply because, as we have discussed, the likelihood that we end up, through this review process in particular, with any big advancements is quite small. However, I also agree with Catherine that the certainty the review might provide, if the TCA endures and neither party backs out of the agreement, is important. We know from the economics literature that one of the main benefits of free trade agreements is that they provide certainty for investors. If the markets maintain the level of openness within the agreement, it makes it harder for Governments to say, 'We are going to protect our own industries here.' Having a review that leads to some changes that will improve implementation is good, but it will also be a signal to investors that the arrangements are going to endure, which should help with investment.",
        "MARK PAWSEY: It is a signal that it is not going to change anything significantly but will provide perhaps a bit more stability, which might give investors an incentive to invest. Do you agree with that?",
        "JOHN SPRINGFORD: Yes, exactly.",
        "MARK PAWSEY: David, do you follow that line?",
        "DAVID HENIG: No, I am slightly more optimistic. On the investment side we have clearly seen a drop-off in investment. There has been a lack of predictability in our arrangements. If we get a more stable approach and we see this as the basis on which we can build where particular issues arise, there is some investment waiting to be unlocked. It does require some UK decisions as well. The big one is in the regulatory space. We have to decide, not just in areas like the carbon border adjustment but across the whole range of industrial goods particularly, whether we are aligning with the EU, which means a single set of costs for business, or looking to do our own thing. Where I am coming from is that on industrial goods, where standards are more global than regional, it makes sense for us to say up front, 'We are in alignment.' That is less the case in services where we perhaps also have more power to set the regulation. That alignment by default approach is one I would see. I am hearing a lot from manufacturing companies that they are struggling to find new customers at the moment. They have kept their existing customers, but they are struggling to find new ones. They are worried that manufacturing could continue to tail off. To go back to cumulation and rules of origin, sorry, it is pretty techy trade speak, but it does matter. Can we ensure that parts that come from Morocco or Turkey can qualify for tariff-free export to the EU or, indeed, the other way round, that our components can be put into a vehicle in Morocco and exported to the EU? If that can all happen without tariffs, which it cannot at the moment, that will make a difference to them as well. There are some clear things we can do that will make a difference. Again, this is not just as part of the review. It is a political process to signal that this is the kind of approach we want to take. We need to be clearer politically. It should be the politics driving the review, not the review driving the politics.",
        "MARK PAWSEY: Professor Usherwood, do you agree with David that there is perhaps an opportunity to tidy things up and make things better or are you a little more cautious?",
        "PROFESSOR USHERWOOD: I agree with what David has been saying. The one additional point I would make is that this is not yet a normal relationship. The disagreements over the Northern Ireland protocol and the words and actions of the British Government about maintaining treaty obligations under the withdrawal agreement still cast a shadow. As much as the Windsor framework has started to repair that relationship and the question of trust and good faith, on the European side there is understandably caution about where this process leads. It is not just about the next Government of a different political complexion but the one after that. If we are thinking about the question of stability and the business environment that creates, we need to think medium to long term rather than just about an alternation of power.",
        "MARK PAWSEY: So there are going to be only very modest changes.",
        "PROFESSOR USHERWOOD: Again, it is a rounding error in macro terms, but you might have some significant localized effects.",
        "JONATHAN GULLIS: Professor Usherwood, you talked to us about the UK side of the relationship and where the EU may have felt aggrieved by UK actions. If I put it the other way round, would you accept that the EU, in terms of the implementation of the protocol, particularly when it came to Northern Ireland, has built up a lot of mistrust and caused a lot of damage to the trade between GB and NI? It is a two-way relationship. It cannot just be constantly put, as we read in our newspapers, on the UK side. The EU has to step up and act in good faith. When I speak to exporters, they say they are taking stuff into ports in different member states and they are meeting different charges on goods, for example ceramics. I am sorry to plug Stoke-on-Trent, Chair. When they are exporting into different member states, whether that be Italy or Spain, they are saying they have different forms to fill in and at times different payments to make because the member states are playing games with trade.",
        "PROFESSOR USHERWOOD: That highlights the need for dialogue. The question of trust is a subjective one as much as it is objective. If you do not trust another party, it does not matter whether you should trust them. You have to feel it. There is a need for ongoing close negotiation, cooperation and dialogue to address those kinds of issues. Where that is against the provisions of the TCA, for example, you then take action to address it. You have extensive dispute settlement mechanisms, if you want to make use of those. Again, two parties come to this. That is maybe the key message of all of this. It is not just about what the UK wants; it is about what the EU wants as well and what they together can agree to do.",
        "JONATHAN GULLIS: Would you agree that the TCA review is better off being more, like you say, a bringing together of people who have been banging their heads against the wall rather than friends coming together once again? It can be used to make technical changes and to show investors that there is stability, that the TCA still holds a lot of strength, that relationships are repairing or repaired in most cases and that there is now a forward-looking approach. Is that what the review should be, rather than anything big and bold, following on from what Mr. Pawsey was saying earlier?",
        "PROFESSOR USHERWOOD: Being friendly does not stop you being big and bold. A constructive atmosphere is certainly much more productive than an antagonistic approach.",
        "JONATHAN GULLIS: Mr. Henig, you talked about dynamic alignment. You will understand that there will be concerns that leaving the European Union but continuing to have a lot of dynamic alignment with its rules and regulations is technically Brexit in name only.",
        "DAVID HENIG: In terms of alignment, I would argue that it is about making the right decisions for the UK. As part of that, where there are in effect global standards, we should be in line with those. We should be in line with the best standards wherever they are because we need to export. Trade is not easy. The UK is not going to be undercutting others. People need to be able to trust our products, whether they are ceramics from Stoke-on-Trent, which they do trust, or, indeed, breweries in Stoke-on-Trent, one of which I am advertising through my cufflinks. They need to trust that we produce fine beer as well as ceramics. Trade is difficult, and there are many things to consider. We need to provide some form of predictability and some stable platform, however we do it. I would try to move away from ideas about Brexit in name only towards what is best for the UK."

That is a dangerous precedent to have, because it undermines the basic principle of co-operation and consent between the Governments, so I would find that problematic in a wider context.",
        "DR ROWAN WILLIAMS: It is a fair comment to make about the mentality that might be generated: that is, you push hard on a rather exceptional piece of legislation, it does not completely bring the house down and, as I put it earlier, you may be inclined subsequently to cut whatever corners can be cut because of that. As a process, that is perhaps what we have been seeing. It is a plausible account of it, which takes us back to the fundamental issue of what protections we need.",

I think everyone recognised the pressures that came following Brexit. However, there have been various statements from various Ministers about their intention to go back to the principles in the Scotland and Wales Act around Sewel. In your gathering of evidence, did you see a shift back to working more to the convention, or did you see no evidence on that?",
        "DR ROWAN WILLIAMS: We did not pick that up in any very strong sense, and that is reflected in some of the responses we had from Westminster on various issues. This may have been overtaken by events, I do not know, but quite often our sense about the responses we had was almost, “Oh, Sewel. Oh, yes”, and kind of dusting off something rather than an immediate awareness that this was something significant.",

        "PROFESSOR LAURA MC ALLISTER: It would be hard to suggest that that was a deliberate strategy, if you like, because in every instance what is being presented to Welsh Government for legislative consent is obviously so different. I guess we are back to the space we referred to earlier about relationships, trust, respect and co-operation, because if there are 11 very different instances of Sewel being ignored and therefore the convention is being eroded, clearly it mentally creates a space where there is less likely to be goodwill towards buying into consent for other areas. That is just an inevitable political consequence. But we were not told that explicitly, so that is my interpretation rather than the evidence.",

        "LORD FALCONER OF THOROTON: Do you think the Sewel convention can be strengthened? You and your commission recommended a duty of solidarity, which is effectively a duty of co-operation between the Welsh Government and the UK Government. Would that involve having to go through a step of consultation, not legislating if it intrudes on devolved responsibilities before you had heard the result from the Welsh and the Scottish Governments, and then not legislating if they say no unless there are exceptional circumstances? If you say there are exceptional circumstances, would you then make a public statement before you move? Is that what you have in mind?",
        "PROFESSOR LAURA MC ALLISTER: Loosely speaking, yes. It should also include delegated legislation. We talked a little about that in the commission, because clearly if Parliament cannot do something then Ministers should not be allowed to do it. Ministers are not sovereign in any sense. It is in relation to those principles, Lord Falconer, that there needs to be a process through which the convention could be operated, at which points there would be exit routes towards protection, whether that was legal or otherwise, because it goes back to the point we made that the flexibility of Sewel is its advantage. We completely accept that, but the flexibility has become a disadvantage in terms of the devolved Governments, so we would have to lose some of that flexibility. But the advantages might be greater in other areas.",
        "LORD FALCONER OF THOROTON: You said rather casually there “whether legal or not”. If you put in a provision that says, “You have to consult, you have to listen to what you are being told by the Welsh Government, you then have to publish reasons if you wish to disagree with them and say that you’re going to legislate in a devolved area”, would you want the courts then to say to the UK Government, for example, “We’re not going to resolve the issue of how you should deal with the internal market Bill issues, but if you’ve not gone through the process of consulting first, the courts can block you from moving to the next stage”? Would you want that sort of solution?",

What I was intending to say was that if that was how the convention was cast legally and in a statutory framework, it might create greater opportunities to consult effectively before it went into a court environment. Ultimately, of course, there would have to be that sanction, because if it did not have that sanction, the system would be pretty much where it is now, and we have already exposed some of the weaknesses of where Sewel is now.",
        "LORD FALCONER OF THOROTON: The alternative route is simply to put it into statute: the UK Government cannot legislate in devolved areas and the settlement must be respected. If the UK Government sought to do so, the courts would have a process of striking those down as being outwith the competence of the UK Parliament. Notwithstanding Section 16 of the Constitutional Act, which says that you cannot legislate in devolved areas, some people would say that you would deal with that simply by saying, “In this exceptional case, we’re going to legislate in that area”. It would be quite difficult to see how it would work in practice. A statement to that effect in a piece of legislation might have some effect. Would you be in favour of that alternative approach?",
        "DR ROWAN WILLIAMS: It is a possible first step. We have not considered this in detail, but it is a possibility.",
        "LORD BURNETT OF MALDON: Professor, in answer to Lord Falconer’s question, you touched on the delegated legislation position. There is much more delegated legislation than there is primary legislation and, as we know, it can cover very profound matters as well. As you noted, the Sewel convention does not apply to delegated legislation. You indicated one way or another that you thought it should. The other area that it does not cover is the use of Henry VIII powers to amend devolved legislation.",

A question that was in my mind as Sally and John were speaking was, given the difficulty of visas for the 90 days and given the different work permits that UK passport holders will have, is any sort of premium being put on the common travel area in the British Isles for Irish passport holders, who will be of greater flexibility for a company if they are going into the European market?",
        "SALLY JONES: I would put it slightly differently, again using anecdata rather than anything that has necessarily been properly crunched.",
        "CHAIR: “Anecdata” is a good pun. I like that, thank you.",
        "SALLY JONES: One of the things that we see in our clients is that, when they are now selecting staff, personnel, to put on projects, if those projects are based in the EU they will often pick people who are EU nationals in the UK under the settled status scheme, because it bypasses all of this. Getting Brits into the right place to service a project at the minute is a difficult egg to crack.",
        "CHAIR: Yes, I understand that. There are eggshells all over the place. We move now to Martin Vickers, my hen-ourable Friend.",
        "MARTIN VICKERS: I feel compelled to say, of course, that three weeks on Cleethorpes beach is far superior to a French holiday.",
        "CHAIR: It is a compromise between the north-west and the south-east, is it not?",
        "MARTIN VICKERS: Can I look specifically at the mutual recognition of professional qualifications and ask you for your thoughts on how your sectors have been affected, and also at whether or not UK-EU negotiations through the Partnership Council could yield some revision or whether we would perhaps be better on individual negotiations with member states?",
        "NEIL ROSS: We have a slightly different take on this one, because generally across the sector MRPQ has not been a massive issue. What we do have a concern about is that, as our sector develops, we are seeing more demand for different kinds of potential professional qualifications. A professional qualification in cybersecurity, for example, has been mooted by DCMS. There is scope in the future for professional qualifications in things like artificial intelligence. There is a question around how the system that we have established with the EU is able to recognise new qualification types as they come on stream and then harmonise those across the bloc. In many ways our ask is about getting a system that is adaptive and responsive as we go forward, whereas I suspect that Sally and John will have issues to raise about how it is working for those qualifications that exist at the moment.",
        "JOHN COOKE: It goes without saying that mutual recognition is incredibly important if UK professionals are to work abroad or EU professionals are to work in the UK. The TCA sets out a framework for this, and it is a key priority. At the moment, as far as I know, professional bodies and regulators are working with counterparts in the EU, often at member state level, to see whether there can be bilateral recognition agreements. It will be very important that they make progress and that we do not find some years on, as we have with the EU-Canada CETA, no mutual recognition has yet materialised under the framework set up in that agreement. Sally may be able to say more from her standpoint on professional services.",
        "SALLY JONES: I don’t hold out a huge amount of hope, if I am being absolutely brutal here. As John says, the language in this deal almost exactly, if not exactly, replicates the language in the Canada deal and nothing has come from that in six years.",
        "MARTIN VICKERS: We also have some experience of situations where regulators had previously got effectively self-negotiated mutual recognition in place as, for example, between the English and Irish audit professions, which has been undone as a result of leaving the single market and has not been replicated by the TCA itself. Our working hypothesis at present is that we should not anticipate that professional qualifications will be mutually recognised any time soon. We may be able to come to some form of regulator-to-regulator agreement on a faster basis, but the environment in which we currently find ourselves is essentially the game we play for the time being. When you refer to six years with no movement in terms of the other agreements, has that been purely governmental intransigence or have the trade bodies, for example, been trying to push towards some sort of settlement?"

        "CHAIRPERSON: Good morning everybody. I haven't still got the gong! In any event I really don't need the gong, thank you very much. I want to welcome you all. First of all I want to welcome the members and I want to welcome the observers and the media who are here today and I also want to welcome all those who are joining us online and on RTE News now on this, the fifth and final weekend meeting in relation to the Eighth Amendment.\n\nOur Work Programme this weekend will take a very different structure to our previous meetings as we gather to make our recommendations as we see fit on the topic of the Eighth Amendment. Before the Secretariat and I take you through today's work programme, I believe it is appropriate that we take a moment to pause and reflect on our work to date and the task ahead of us this weekend.\n\nWhen we all came together for the first meeting in November, it was clear to me that within the room there was a wide range of experiences, opinions and ideas on the Eighth Amendment. A topic that has at times convulsed the Nation and I doubt that there were many among us who were not in some daunted by the task ahead of us. I include myself in that, needless to say. This is one of the most complex and contentious subjects in Irish society and we could not but feel the weight on our shoulders and I again include myself in that and yet by participating in the Assembly, we have been afforded a unique opportunity as this exercise in deliberative democracy has allowed us to withdraw from the polarising perspectives and begin first and foremost with the facts.\n\nThe process we followed saw us begin with facts and divest ourselves of opinion. Consequently we did not follow the more familiar path on this topic, where equal time is provided to each side of the argument, although as you know we did on the last weekend when we heard the Advocacy Groups. We maintained a balance on that occasion. The process we followed, I believe, has contributed greatly to the standard of information that we have received on this topic. We also listened carefully to your feedback and our work programme evolved with your valuable inputs and I'm sure you appreciated that. Indeed, since the first weekend I have observed that you listen, engage and challenge some of the most experienced medical, legal and ethical experts and advocates on the subject. I have watched as you have engaged with some of the most complex pieces of legislation, immersed yourselves in medical and ethical discourse and listened with respect to the voices and opinions of others. Your overall commitment to this process has continually provided the Secretariat and me with much encouragement and I say that genuinely. Given the level of commitment you have shown to date, I have no doubt that you will show equal commitment to the task ahead of us this weekend.\n\nNow, what is the task? In absolute terms it is to make recommendations and I want to emphasise that. It is to make recommendations as we see fit to the Oireachtas on the topic of the Eighth Amendment. There are very few people who will have the breadth of knowledge you have on this topic after our previous weekend sessions and you have an opportunity to bring this knowledge and your understanding of it to our elected representatives.\n\nThese recommendations will be made primarily through a balloted vote. It is important that when you vote you do so with your own conscience and with competence and conviction. We must all be satisfied that the recommendations once made are a fair representation of the work of the Assembly. Now, I want to say something about the weekend work programme and I'm going to describe it in very broad terms at this stage. At the end of the March meeting of the Assembly you were invited to make comments and preliminary suggestions on the types of issues we thought should be voted upon or included on a ballot paper for the final weekend. Comments and suggestions could refer to legal avenues and/or aspects of the substantive issue.\n\nThe Secretariat collated these suggestions and this informed the preparation of the draft ballot paper, which we circulated to you before Easter. This work was led by me, with the assistance of the Secretariat and members of the Steering Group, with whom we met twice for input and most importantly with the assistance of the Expert Advisory Group with whom we conferred weekly actually and we spent a long number of hours. I was tempted, in fact I asked Sharon, how many hours did we spend on the ballot paper and it was a lot of time. A lot of time, maybe 15 hours perhaps, yes.\n\nAs Assembly Members you know well the complexities of the Eighth Amendment as a piece of law and this is reflected in the draft ballot received before Easter. It is complex. Significant time and effort was given to preparing and structuring a ballot that is legally robust, affords you all the opportunity for real input and importantly provides us with enough information to make real and substantial recommendations to the Houses of the Oireachtas. The ballot paper has by necessity more than one question and it is sequential in nature, meaning that later ballots are dependent on the outcome of earlier ballots. Likewise, depending on the votes on earlier questions, not all later questions in the ballot paper may be reached.\n\nNow, what you have before you at the moment is a draft and I emphasise that, a draft ballot paper and it remains a draft ballot paper. As our agenda for the weekend reflects, we have allocated plenty of time for your questions, for discussion and for agreeing on the wording of each individual ballot before we vote. To assist in this regard and indeed to provide you with legal and medical or legal information or legal clarification, we will benefit from the expertise of the Expert Advisory Group who you all know well and whom I'll introduce again later.\n\nTheir role, and I want to emphasise this, will be to answer questions on specific issues related to the ballot paper. Now I emphasise that, related to the ballot paper, rather than on a wider range of questions about the content the citizens have heard over the previous four weekends. So bear that in mind. The questions relate to specific issues in relation to the ballot paper. Further to this, if you, the members, wish to raise issues or suggest changes it may be necessary for me to adjourn briefly to reflect on the suggested amendments. Any suggested amendments may be incorporated by agreement following this consideration, though we must remain mindful of the inconsistencies which may be given rise to in other parts of the ballot paper and that is very important. The Secretariat, the Expert Advisory Group and myself, as I say, we have put an awful lot of work into this and we are fully conscious of the risk of inconsistencies and you have to bear that in mind.\n\nBefore your discussions on each ballot paper, I will provide you with a detailed explanation of the format and wording of each. This explanation will also provide detail on how the results of each draft ballot will be presented and what constitutes a majority vote in each case.\n\nNow, voting, I had a private session with the members and they are fully aware and have noted this but as you can see, as everybody can see, we have voting booths in the room this weekend. The voting booth and the secret ballot are fundamental symbols and tenets of democracy and about this I have enlisted the expertise of the retired Returning Officer for County Dublin, John Fitzpatrick and his team who are with us and they are sitting over there, who will provide independent oversight for the process.\n\nI must at this point take the opportunity to thank John and his team for all their assistance to date, which has been invaluable and I mean that. It has been invaluable. Voting will be done in secret. Members will register for and collect the final agreed ballot and will move to cast their vote in the booth. The completed ballot papers will then be placed in ballot boxes. Mr. Fitzpatrick and his team will also be responsible for the counting of the ballot papers and the accurate presentation of the results. So, our whole objective is to produce an accurate result.\n\nNow, in relation to the announcements of the results. It is intended that the results of each ballot will be announced as soon as the votes have been counted and verified.\nCHAIR: I will announce the result in public session and depending on the outcome there may be a multiple of votes over the weekend. I will, in the interests of absolute openness and transparency, be providing the votes in absolute terms. In other words, in numbers as well as in percentage terms.\n\nNow, I just want to speak about something which I have variously been calling miscellaneous recommendations and ancillary recommendations. The votes will form the recommendation that goes to the Houses of the Oireachtas. However, in your feedback at our last meeting, many of you indicated that you would like to see wider policy issues as distinct from just legal challenges, reflected in the recommendations of the Assembly. I am strongly of the view that you have almost uniquely comprehensive understanding of this topic and it is important that we capture these ancillary recommendations. Therefore, we will circulate a response form for you to fill in and any emerging consensus, themes or issues which emerge from your response to that form will be included as recommendations in the final report.\n\nFor those watching the Assembly online or on RTE now, thank you for your continued engagement with the Assembly. You may be interested to note that a full agenda for the weekend is available to view online, though it is subject to possible changes and times and all of that, depending on how things pan out. All the background papers, presentations and draft ballots prepared for the Assembly will become available on our website throughout the course of the weekend. Likewise, all material that is given to members, including a synopsis of each of the meetings to date is also available to the public on our website and that's www.citizensassembly.ie.\n\nNow, in the interests of openness and transparency we are conducting as much of this weekend's proceedings, including the voting in public. Each member of course, it is not necessary to say this, each member will of course vote in secrecy and anonymously in the booths.\n\nNow, the next heading I have on this paper is conclusion and I must preface my remarks by advising that you will be hearing an awful lot more from me before the day is out and before the weekend is out. So, that is the context in which I want to talk about conclusion. Finally, and in conclusion, let me thank you for your work to date. You have contributed to raising the level of discourse on this subject and you have shown the inherent value in respect of different views or opinions. Let us continue in this spirit of collegiality for the remainder of the weekend. I would now like to call on SHARON FINEGAN, the Secretary to the Assembly, to present the proposed structure of the ballot paper and this will be on screen and this is very, very important. This will give you an understanding of where we're going and I would ask you to really concentrate on this. Thank you very much.",
        "MS. FINEGAN: Many thanks Justice Laffoy. I just have a couple of things to do here just to get this set up. So, before I begin, just a couple of things to say. The purpose of the presentation that I am about to give is to walk you, the members, and those of you watching at home, walk you through the complete ballot paper. It is important that before casting any vote, members understand the full potential implications of each. To do this they must understand how the draft ballot paper hangs together and how the sequencing will work. As Justice Laffoy has said, the members received this draft ballot paper before Easter. As such, you, the members, are already familiar with it. For those of you watching online, the ballot paper that I am about to walk through is now available on the website and I would encourage you to read through it as I go through this presentation. I have to say that this is not, this presentation I am about to give is not designed to be a precise explanation of the wording used or the legal issues underpinning each ballot. Justice Laffoy, as she has said, you will be hearing from her throughout the weekend. She will be providing that detail later as required and if required. Instead this presentation is aimed at aiding your understanding of the structure and how each draft ballot connects with the next. So, we'll begin. So ballot one asks the members, draft ballot one I should say, asks the members \"do you think Article 40.3.3 should be retained in full or not retained in full?\" In this ballot you have two options. Option 1. Option 1 is \"Article 40.3.3 should be retained in full.\" So that's the first option on this ballot paper that you are being presented with. In the event that this is where the majority of members cast their vote in, in other words if the majority of members, having collated the votes, decide that they wish to retain Article 40.3.3 in full, that there be no change, the voting process is complete and the work for the day completes. So when the Judge announces the results of that at 12.05, if the results are that Article 40.3.3 is to be retained, that is where our work will essentially conclude. Option 2 is that Article 40.3.3 should not be retained in full. In the event that the majority of the citizens decide this option, we will then proceed to Ballot 2. So, moving on Ballot 2. Ballot 2 asks the citizens \"do you think Article 40.3.3 should be repealed, i.e. deleted and not replaced or replaced or amended?\" And once again, well the options that are presented here, the citizens have three voting options. There is Option 1 and Option 2 but also what appears here is \"prefer not to state an opinion\" and in private session this morning a citizen has already the question why is \"prefer not to state an opinion\" provided on this ballot paper as an option and I suppose it is there for a very important reason and that reason is that if in Ballot 1, we have gotten to Ballot 2 by virtue of the fact that a majority of the citizens have decided that they do not want to retain Article 40.3.3 in full. However, it is possible and likely that in that scenario, some citizens would have opted for Option 1, in that they did not want to see Article 40.3.3 changed and therefore it is important that they have an opportunity on the Ballot Paper to continue to express a view and that they are not forced into selecting Option 1 or 2. So it is important that they have a place on the Ballot Paper in which to record their viewpoint. That is of course not to say that somebody who had voted that way on Ballot 1 would not want to express an opinion and that is not to say that they couldn't express an opinion in Option 1 or Option 2 but it is there precisely so that they are not forced into that position. So, the two options then presented on Ballot 2 are Option 1, that Article 40.3.3 should be repealed, i.e. deleted and not replaced. So, if the majority of citizens select Option 1 here, we then proceed to Ballot 4 (a). So, in other words, the majority of the citizens have decided that Article 40.3.3 should be repealed and in her introductory remarks to Ballot 2, Justice Laffoy will provide full context as to what that decision would mean and so on but if they decide a majority, to vote for repeal, a further ballot is provided to ask some additional information of them about the recommendations that they would like to make to the Oireachtas, about the termination of pregnancy in Ireland and the right to life of the unborn. So, just to run through the structure of this ballot paper, there are, as you'll see, eight reasons listed in columns on the left-hand side, sorry, rows on the left-hand side and then there are five separate columns then provided. So I'll talk you through each of those in turn now. So, in relation to the reasons, the first two, one and two, one is the \"real and substantial physical risk to the life of the woman\" and number two is \"the real and substantial risk to the life of the woman by suicide.\" So, in other words, these are reasons that the citizens may decide to see termination of pregnancy permitted in Ireland. The reason why I highlight these two in particular, firstly is that these are the two provisions currently provided for in the 2013 Act. On the remainder of the reasons listed in the Ballot Paper, reasons 3 to 8, you will see that they are provided for individually. - The serious risk to the physical health of the woman; - The serious risk to the mental health of the woman; - Pregnancy as a result of rape; - The unborn child has a foetal abnormality that is likely to result in death before or shortly after birth. - The unborn child has a significant foetal abnormality that is not likely to result in death before or shortly after birth or - Available on request, i.e. no restriction as to reasons. So there are eight options or reasons provided and in each case the citizens are able to select, express their opinion in a number of different ways. So, in each case they can say never for this reason. So in other words, it gives the citizens an opportunity to say that in no circumstances do they want to see that particular reason provided for in legislation or through the law. In respect of B 1, B 2 and B 3, we have three options there which relate to gestational limits or no gestational limits. So, B 1 is up to 12 weeks, gestation only. B 2 is up to 22 weeks, gestation only and B 3 is with no restriction as to gestational age and you'll note that the letters across the top. So A is a category on its own. So never for this reason. So just to go back to that. B's then are collectively provided there on the ballot paper. SO THAT GIVES YOU AN INDICATION THAT THEY ARE GOING TO BE GROUPED AND AGAIN THE CHAIR WILL GO THROUGH THIS IN SOME DETAIL IN THE EVENT THAT WE ARRIVE AT THIS BALLOT BUT I SUPPOSE THE IMPORTANT THING TO NOTE HERE IS THAT OPTION A AND YOU'LL SEE ACROSS THE TOP, OPTION A, B 1, B 2 AND B 3 ARE COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS RECOMMENDATIONS. SO, THESE FOUR COLUMNS WILL BE ADDED UP TO PRESENT THE OPINIONS EXPRESSED BY THE CITIZENS AS TO RECOMMENDATIONS. SO, FOR THE PURPOSES OF DETERMINING A MAJORITY, ALL OF B 1, B 2 AND B 3 WILL BE ADDED TOGETHER TO PROVIDE THE TOTALITY OF CITIZENS WHO HAVE VOTED IN FAVOUR OF ABORTION OR THE TERMINATION OF PREGNANCY IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES WITH GESTATIONAL LIMITS OR NONE. THEN MOVING ON TO C, AGAIN IT IS PREFER NOT TO STATE AN OPINION AND AGAIN FOR THE SAME REASONS I OUTLINED PREVIOUSLY, THAT'S IMPORTANT TO INCLUDE THERE AND I SUPPOSE NOT LEAST TO REFLECT THE FACT THAT THERE MAY BE SOMEBODY WHO HAS VOTED IN BALLOT 1 THAT THEY DIDN'T WANT CHANGE BUT ALSO SOMEBODY WHO DID VOTE FOR CHANGE MAY ACTUALLY JUST NOT WANT TO STATE AN OPINION. SO THAT'S PROVIDED FOR THERE. SO, GOING BACK TO BALLOT 2, SO I'VE JUST TALKED YOU THROUGH WHAT HAPPENS IF THE CITIZENS SELECT OPTION 1 IN BALLOT 2. I AM NOW GOING TO TALK YOU THROUGH WHAT HAPPENS IF THE CITIZENS SELECT OPTION 2 IN BALLOT 2 AND JUST TO RECALL OPTION 2 IN BALLOT 2 IS THAT ARTICLE 40.3.3 SHOULD BE REPLACED OR AMENDED. SO IF THE MAJORITY OF CITIZENS SELECT THIS OPTION WE THEN PROCEED TO BALLOT 3. SO BALLOT 3 ASKS THE FOLLOWING QUESTION, HOW DO YOU THINK ARTICLE 40.3.3 SHOULD BE CHANGED AND OPTION 1 HERE, AGAIN JUST TO BE CLEAR, THERE ARE THREE VOTING OPTIONS PROVIDED FOR THE CITIZENS. OPTION 1 WHICH I'LL DESCRIBE IN A MOMENT. OPTION 2, WHICH I'LL ALSO DESCRIBE AND AGAIN the PREFER NOT TO STATE AN OPINION REASON IS PROVIDED THERE FOR THE SAME REASONS THAT I'VE OUTLINED EARLIER. SO LOOKING AT OPTION 1. OPTION 1 IS THAT ARTICLE 40.3.3 SHOULD BE REPLACED WITH A CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION THAT EXPLICITLY AUTHORIZES THE OIREACHTAS TO LEGISLATE TO ADDRESS BOTH TERMINATION OF PREGNANCY AND ANY RIGHTS OF THE UNBORN. SO, ESSENTIALLY WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT THE CITIZENS WILL VOTE THAT A NEW -- THAT ARTICLE 40.3.3 WOULD BE DELETED. THAT A NEW CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION WOULD BE PUT IN WHICH EXPLICITLY PLACES THE POWER, IF I CAN USE THAT TERM, FULLY IN THE HANDS OF THE OIREACHTAS. IN THE EVENT THAT THE MAJORITY SELECTS THAT OPTION WE WILL MOVE TO BALLOT 4 B IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE AND THE TABLE THAT I'M GOING TO PUT HERE, DRAFT BALLOT 4 B, LOOKS EXACTLY THE SAME AS BALLOT 4 A BUT IT IS DESCRIBED DIFFERENTLY BECAUSE IT IS DOING A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT THING, BECAUSE IN BALLOT 3, IF YOU HAVE SELECTED OPTION 2, OPTION 1, YOU HAVE, APOLOGIES, IF YOU HAVE SELECTED OPTION 1 YOU HAVE EXPLICITLY SAID THAT YOU WANT THE OIREACHTAS TO HAVE CONTROL AND SO THEREFORE, AND THAT THE CONSTITUTION WILL PROVIDE FOR THAT AND THEREFORE BALLOT 4 B IS THEN PROVIDING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO THE OIREACHTAS ABOUT HOW YOU THINK THEY SHOULD EXERCISE THAT CONTROL. SO, IT DOES A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT THING TO BALLOT 4 A. IT LOOKS THE SAME BUT IT DOES A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT THING. SO I DON'T PROPOSE TO GO THROUGH IT IN DETAIL IN THE WAY THAT I DID PREVIOUSLY EXCEPT TO SAY THAT IT IS THE SAME TEXT. THE EIGHT REASONS THAT ARE LISTED IN THE ROWS ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE ARE THE SAME. THE COLUMNS ACROSS THE TOP ARE AGAIN ALSO THE SAME AND THE MANNER IN WHICH THEY'LL BE REPORTED AND JUSTICE LAFFOY WILL EXPLAIN THIS IN THE EVENT THAT WE COME TO THIS BALLOT, SHE'LL EXPLAIN HOW THE REPORTING AND SO ON, WILL TAKE PLACE BUT JUST TO SAY THAT IT DOES LOOK THE SAME. TO GO BACK THEN TO BALLOT 3. SO WHAT WE'VE JUST TALKED THROUGH IS IN BALLOT 3, IF YOU PICK OPTION 1, YOU MOVE ON BALLOT 4 C. IF IN BALLOT 3 YOU SELECT OPTION 2. LET US LOOK AT WHAT OPTION 2 SAYS. IT SAYS THAT \"ARTICLE 40.3.3 SHOULD BE REPLACED OR AMENDED WITH A NEW CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION THAT DIRECTLY ADDRESSES BOTH TERMINATION OF PREGNANCY AND ANY RIGHTS OF THE UNBORN.\" SO, IN OTHER WORDS YOU ARE TAKING, YOU'VE DECIDED THAT YOU WANT TO DELETE OR AMEND ARTICLE 40.3.3 AND TO CONTINUE TO HAVE SOME LEVEL OF CONSTITUTIONAL -- THAT THE CONSTITUTION CONTINUE TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THE TERMINATION OF PREGNANCY AND ANY RIGHTS OF THE UNBORN. SO IN THE EVENT THAT YOU SELECT OPTION 2 HERE ON BALLOT 3, WE THEN MOVE TO BALLOT 4 C. NOW, BALLOT 4 C HAS TWO PARTS AND AGAIN, PART ONE LOOKS THE SAME AS BALLOT 4 A AND 4 B. IT'S THE SAME THING. IT IS DOING ESSENTIALLY THE SAME THING THAT IT DID IN BALLOT 4 A, BALLOT 4 B, IN THAT YOU ARE -- AGAIN IT IS GIVING THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE ASSEMBLY AS TO THE REASONS, IF ANY, WHICH THE CITIZENS OR THE MEMBERS OF THE CITIZENS ASSEMBLY CONSIDER THAT THE TERMINATION OF PREGNANCY SHOULD BE LAWFUL IN IRELAND. SO, AGAIN I WON'T GO THROUGH THAT IN DETAIL. I WILL, HOWEVER, GO THROUGH PART 2. SO PART 2 IS INCLUDED HERE BECAUSE JUST THINKING BACK TO HOW WE GOT HERE. SO, BALLOT 3, WE'VE OPTED FOR OPTION 2 AND IN OPTION 2 IF YOU SELECT THIS, THE MAJORITY HAVE DECIDED THAT THEY STILL WANT THE CONSTITUTION TO HAVE SOME LEVEL OF SAY IN RELATION TO THESE MATTERS. SO WHAT THIS BALLOT ATTEMPTS TO DO IS TO CAPTURE WHICH ASPECTS YOU WANT TO SEE REGULATED BY THE CONSTITUTION AND WHICH ELEMENTS YOU'RE SATISFIED SHOULD JUST BE IN LEGISLATION. SO, AGAIN THE FORMAT AND THE STRUCTURE OF THIS PART OF THE BALLOT LOOKS A LOT LIKE 4 A, 4 B AND 4 C IN THAT, AND THE FIRST PART OF 4 C, IN THAT IT HAS THE SAME REASONS LISTED ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE. THE SAME EIGHT REASONS. HOWEVER, IT HAS THREE DIFFERENT COLUMNS HERE. FIRSTLY, I'LL REFER TO (III) WHICH IS PREFER NOT TO STATE AN OPINION AND ONCE AGAIN THAT'S PROVIDED HERE FOR THE REASONS THAT I OUTLINED PREVIOUSLY AND (I) IS THAT THE CITIZENS WOULD BE DECIDING THAT EACH OF THESE REASONS WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED PRIMARILY BY A PROVISION IN THE CONSTITUTION WITH THE OIREACHTAS PASSING LEGISLATION TO FILL IN THE DETAILS. IN OTHER WORDS THAT THE CONSTITUTION WOULD SPECIFICALLY DEAL WITH THE REASONS AS LISTED ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE. (II) IS THAT THE REASONS WOULD BE DEALT WITH BY LEGISLATION ONLY. SO, IN OTHER WORDS THIS BALLOT ALLOWS YOU TO EXPRESS. YOU'VE SAID IN THE EVENT THAT THE CITIZENS ARRIVE AT THIS BALLOT, YOU'VE SAID THAT YOU WANT THE CONSTITUTION TO HAVE SOME CONTROL AND THIS IS ESSENTIALLY ALLOWING YOU TO EXPRESS WHERE YOU WANT THE CONSTITUTION TO HAVE THAT CONTROL. THAT'S SORT OF A VERY LAYMAN'S OWN VIEW OF HOW THAT HANGS TOGETHER IN THAT PARTICULAR PART OF THE BALLOT. SO, AS I SAY, JUSTICE LAFFOY WILL BRING US THROUGH EACH OF THE BALLOTS, BEGINNING WITH BALLOT 1, PROVIDING A DETAILED EXPLANATION AS TO THE WORDING, WHAT EACH MEANS AND SO ON BUT IT WAS JUST VERY IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO BE ABLE TO SEE SEQUENTIALLY HOW EACH OF THOSE BALLOTS HANG TOGETHER. THAT IS, OF COURSE, VISIBLE FROM THE MARKERS ON THE BALLOT PAPER. WE HAVE INSTRUCTIONS, YOU KNOW if the majority votes this way where you go. SO, I THINK IT SHOULD BE FAIRLY CLEAR BUT IT IS JUST USEFUL I THINK TO SEE IT ALL HANG TOGETHER THERE. SO YOU CAN BEGIN TO SEE HOW YOUR VOTE MIGHT TAKE SHAPE DEPENDING ON WHAT THE OUTCOME OF BALLOT ONE IS. SO, I HOPE YOU FOUND THAT USEFUL. IT IS AVAILABLE ONLINE. THIS PRESENTATION IS",
        "CHAIRPERSON: NOW, AS YOU PROBABLY NOTICED FROM THE AGENDA, WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE ROUND TABLE DISCUSSION IN RELATION TO BALLOT 1, WHICH I'M ABOUT TO EXPLAIN TO YOU AND WE FORMED THE VIEW THAT IT IS RELATIVELY STRAIGHTFORWARD AND IT DOESN'T NEED A ROUND TABLE DISCUSSION. SO, WHEN I'M FINISHED WITH THE EXPLANATION WE'LL GO STRAIGHT INTO A Q&A SESSION AND THE TEXT OF BALLOT 1 IS ON THE SCREEN. I'M NOT DOING THIS BUSINESS, SHARON IS DOING IT. FIRST OF ALL THE BALLOT PAPER PROVIDES A BRIEF EXPLANATORY TEXT WHICH CONTEXTUALISES OUR WORK. IT EXPLAINS THAT THE ROLE AS LAID DOWN FOR US BY THE OIREACHTAS IS TO CONSIDER THE EIGHTH AMENDMENT. NOW, THE EIGHTH AMENDMENT WAS INSERTED INTO THE CONSTITUTION, ARTICLE 40, SUBSECTION 3, SORRY, ARTICLE 40, SECTION 3, SUBSECTION 3, WHICH LIKE SHARON, I WILL CALL ARTICLE 40.3.3 FROM NOW ON AND THE 13TH AND THE 14TH AMENDMENTS ADDED ADDITIONAL CLAUSES TO THAT ARTICLE AND WE'VE COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IT IS MORE ACCURATE TO DISCUSS ARTICLE 40.3.3 RATHER THAN THE EIGHTH AMENDMENT AND THAT IS THE TERMINOLOGY WE HAVE USED THROUGHOUT THE BALLOT PAPERS. SO, AS I SAY, WHEN DISCUSSING YOUR TASK, WE WILL BE TALKING ABOUT ARTICLE 40.3.3. NOW, BALLOT 1 IS OUR BASIC STARTING POINT. DOES THE ASSEMBLY WANT TO RETAIN ARTICLE 40.3.3 IN FULL OR NOT. HERE THE WORD 'RETAIN' IS USED TO DEMONSTRATE THAT WE ARE STARTING FROM THE STATUS QUO, WHAT THE LAW IS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS BALLOT IS TO ESTABLISH WHETHER YOU, THE MEMBERS OF THE CITIZENS ASSEMBLY, WISH TO CHANGE THE STATUS QUO IN SOME SHAPE OR FORM AND YOU HAVE TWO OPTIONS. IN THIS BALLOT THERE ARE ONLY TWO OPTIONS. UNLIKE THE OTHER OPTIONS. OPTION 1 IS TO RETAIN ARTICLE 40.3.3. IF THE MEMBERS DECIDE THEY WISH TO DO THAT, IF THEY WISH THAT ARTICLE 40.3.3 IS RETAINED IN FULL, THERE WILL BE NO FURTHER BALLOTS OF VOTING. IT WILL BE THE END OF THE PROCESS EFFECTIVELY EXCEPT FOR A REFLECTIVE -- WHAT I CALLED THE ANCILLARY REFLECTIONS I REFERRED TO EARLIER. SO THAT WOULD BE THE END OF THE PROCESS. OPTION 2 IS THAT ARTICLE 40.3.3 SHOULD NOT BE RETAINED IN FULL AND IF YOU THE MEMBERS VOTE FOR OPTION 2, BY MAJORITY, YOU WILL HAVE INDICATED THAT YOU WISH TO CHANGE THE CURRENT CONSTITUTIONAL POSITION IN SOME WAY. Therefore, if you decide that you do not wish that Article 40.3.3 is retained in full, we will proceed at that stage to the second draft ballot paper and I want you to be clear that if the Oireachtas was to act on this option, a Constitutional Referendum would be required. Once the members have voted on this ballot, the results will be reported on. The agenda provides, as you will have seen, that this would take place around five minutes past 12. Now, I want to say something about the presentation of results. The members have been provided with a note on the voting procedures to be used over the course of the weekend and this has been put up on the website for the wider public. There are two specific aspects of this document, which I would now like to draw to your attention. The first is in relation to how the results will be presented. A sample results sheet for this ballot is provided on the screen behind me. You see that Reporting of Results, Ballot 1. You will see that the count and the result, the voting, will provide some key information. First, it will specify the number of citizens eligible to vote. That's in the first line. Then, it will specify the number of citizens who actually voted. In theory, this figure should be the same as the first but there may be reasons why a discrepancy might arise. For example, if a citizen decides not to cast his or her vote. Those two figures aren't necessarily going to be the same. Thirdly, you will see the results of the ballot presented in both absolute terms in numbers and in percentage terms. Both figures are provided for transparency and clarity. Where there is more than one option on the ballot this will obviously be represented here too. Now, I want to say something. Make some general observations about spoiled votes. The note you have also specifies how we will deal with spoiled votes. In formulating our rules in relation to voting, we've had regard to the principles applied in National elections. There a vote which does not express a clear preference or which expresses multiple preferences, where only one is sought, is a spoiled vote. For the purposes of voting at the Citizens Assembly, for the purpose of voting here today these rules apply and a spoiled vote arises in the following circumstances and I'm going to mention two circumstances. The first is where the vote does not mark any option for -- sorry, where the voter does not mark any option for one or more questions. For the avoidance of doubt, a voter who has specifically marked '(b) prefer not to state an opinion' box will not fall into this category because in such a case the intention of the voter is clear. The voter has decided not to express an opinion. However, if a voter does not mark any option for one or more questions, it is not clear whether the voter did not wish to express a preference or whether they simply overlooked that particular question. Therefore, a ballot or part of a ballot which does not contain one mark should be counted as a spoiled vote for that particular question. That would not affect the validity of other questions on the same ballot paper. So, you want to be careful when you are exercising your right to vote. Now, the second circumstance is this. A ballot will also be considered as spoiled if the voter marks more than one option in a single question. So, that's the second circumstance. In this case, that I've just outlined, again it is not possible to determine the intention of the voter so the vote should be treated as invalid. Now, that completes my description of this ballot which, as I said at the outset, we consider to be fairly simple and the arrangements for voting. You will have learned something from the explanation in relation to presentation of the results, which I hope has been helpful to you and also to the issue of spoiled votes. So, as I have said at the outset, we're not having a round table discussion on this. So, we're going to move straight into the questions and answers session and I am going to be joined by the lawyers on the Expert Advisory Group. Dr. Oran Doyle from Trinity College; Professor Deirdre Madden from University College Cork and Dr. Rachael Walsh from Trinity College Dublin and they will assist in responding to your questions and comments concerning the wording of the draft Ballot 1 and just to remind you what I said in the private session earlier, what they are going to address are specific issues in relation to the ballot paper. They are not going to address issues in relation to the wider context. For example, the content of presentations we had over the earlier weeks. So, also bear in mind that there are mics available and also bear in mind what I said earlier about speaking slowly and clearly so that the Stenographer can capture everything that is said. Thank you very much. END OF EXPLANATION OF WORDING ON DRAFT BALLOT 1 I can answer that question and I will be dealing with that later. Apparently it might have been wise to deal with it on this explanation. You have been given the resolution of the Oireachtas in the material you were given this morning, isn't that right, and you will see that it provides that if there is equality of votes the Chairperson has the casting vote. So that really answers that. I will explain that more fully later but that's the position. So if on the first ballot there was 40 and 40 the Chairperson would have a casting vote and incidentally, I mean I've done my homework on this particular issue, and it sort of reflects the position of the Ceann Comhairle in the Dáil. If there isn't a majority in the sense that there's equality of votes, the Ceann Comhairle has the casting vote and the wording used in the resolution is very similar to the wording in Article 15, section 11 of the Constitution. So that answers that question. We're only dealing with Ballot 1 at the moment. Obviously we will have to cross that bridge if we come to it. I haven't given it a lot of consideration.",
        "MS. FINEGAN: I'll just, to be clear, because in fairness it was the Judge who twigged this more than anybody. So in the event that the majority votes for -- so for the purposes of determining a majority and this is provided for in the note that the Judge referred to about the voting procedures. So for the purposes of determining a majority, you'll see on your note, that note, on page two of that note it says 'in Ballot 1 a majority be determined by a reference to the total votes cast in favour of Option 1 and Option 2' but in relation to Ballot 2 and 3 that you've just asked about, the majority in those cases will be determined by a reference to the total votes cast in favour of both Option 1 and Option 2. So in other words the results will count the fact -- you know in absolute it will say. So for argument's sake it is 33, 33, 33, across the three options but for the purposes of majority only the votes cast in respect of Option 1 and Option 2 will be counted and then used to determine the majority.",
        "CHAIRPERSON: In fact I would be reiterating that in relation to every ballot paper for the avoidance of doubt. So, do you follow that? Sorry, for causing the confusion at the start. Any other questions?",
        "MS. FINEGAN: Sorry, could I just interrupt you. We are focusing only on Ballot 1 for the purpose of this Question and Answer session. Absolutely. In every case, in the event that we arrive at those ballots, it will be exactly the same format as this for questions.",
        "CHAIRPERSON: In fact having followed a round table discussion, as I've said, this is the only ballot in relation to which we're not having a round table discussion because it was just the two options and they were phrased in plain language, we thought it wasn't necessary. So the members seem to be happy that they understand what is asked of them in Ballot 1. Well then we will move on to Ballot 1 and the voting.",
        "MS. FINEGAN: Okay, can I just have your attention please in relation to the voting. The first thing to say is just as previously discussed, the facilitators and notetakers will leave the room during this portion while the votes are being cast. The voting will continue to happen in public. Just I'll call on my colleagues from the Secretariat. Grainne, you might begin to set up the desks there for the voting. So what is going to happen, you'll see at each of the Voting Booths there are tables. So you will go up to each of the tables and you'll see each of them have been marked. There are three individual booths and they indicate which table. So, according to which table you're on, you go to each individual table to collect your ballot paper.",
        "CHAIRPERSON: So a member of the Secretariat will be there with a list of the names and just for the purposes of counting the number of citizens who have collected their ballot papers, we will be marking who has collected them but that is in no way to suggest that your ballot paper is individualized or anything, it is entirely anonymous. Then you will proceed to the Voting Booths to cast your ballot and you will place them in the ballot boxes. There is a ballot box for each individual ballot paper. We want to convert the draft ballot paper into the ballot paper and I presume that there is agreement on that. So could I have a show of hands in relation to whether there is agreement in relation to the form of the ballot paper?",
        "MS. FINEGAN: Can I just have everybody's attention for that. Just the Chair is seeking a formal agreement on the ballot paper. If you could raise your hands?",
        "CHAIRPERSON: Very good, thank you.",
        "MS. FINEGAN: So, if you want to proceed therefore up to each of the desks to collect your ballot paper and I'd just ask for your patience obviously because it will take a couple of minutes to disperse the ballots. Once you have finished your vote you can go ahead and have your coffee. We will essentially have a break now between voting and counting of the ballot.",
        "CHAIRPERSON: Good afternoon everybody. We have now passed mid-day, so I can wish you good afternoon and I'm going to announce the result of Ballot 1 but just before I do so, I just want to say that it was agreed this morning that two members of the Steering Group would observe the count and that has happened and everything is satisfactory from that point of view. The result will go up on the screen behind me and I will read it out. This is the result of Ballot 1, the number of eligible voters 91. Number of votes cast 91. Invalid votes nil, zero and total valid poll 91 and the voting for Option 1, Article 40.3.3 should be retained in full, that was 12 votes or 13% and Option 2, Article 40.3.3 should not be retained in full, 79 votes, equivalent to 87%. So, just by way of explanation I'll explain the number of eligible votes as being 91. That is explained, currently there are 95 members of the Assembly and all of that information is on the website and four of those were unable to attend this morning and that explains the figure of 91. I just wanted to give an explanation of that. Now, as you see the majority voted in favour of Option 2. Namely that Article 40.3.3 should not be retained in full and a consequence of that we are moving on to Ballot 2 now and I'm going to explain Ballot 2. The voting on Ballot 2 which we've just seen, sorry, the voting on Ballot 1 which we've just seen, represents a clear decision that the members seek to change the status quo and to be clear, if the Oireachtas was to act on this initial recommendation a Constitutional Referendum would be required. I want to make that clear but the result is a mandate for the Assembly to move forward with the formation of our recommendations for the Houses of the Oireachtas. Ballot 2, which I'm discussing now, will look at the legal nature of the desired change. The proposed text of Draft Ballot 2 as prepared by myself and the Secretariat, again with the assistance of the expert advisory group and the input of the Steering Group is on the screen behind me. You'll see it now. The proposed wording on the question on this ballot reads: \"Do you think Article 40.3.3 should be repealed, i.e., deleted and not replaced or replaced or amended?\" The members have three voting options before them and these are now presented on the screen. Option 1 is that Article 40.3.3 should be repealed. We're back in business thankfully and you'll recollect that when we stopped I was dealing with Draft Ballot Paper 2 and I was going through the options on the Ballot Paper and Option 1 is Article 40.3.3 should be repealed, i.e., delete it and not replaced. Option 2 is Article 40.3.3 should be replaced or amended and then the third option is \"prefer not to state an opinion\" and I'm going to deal with each of those options in turn, starting with Option 1. Option 1, repeal would involve the deletion of Article 40.3.3 from the Constitution. The text would be deleted in full from the Constitution and at our last meeting, at the last weekend meeting, Brian Murray, Senior Counsel, outlined the potential consequences of repeal and in advance of this meeting, we encouraged the members to re-read Brian's paper and a copy of it has been included in the briefing packs and you now have the correct paper, but in any event the important point is that it cannot be said with certainty which consequence would prevail if Article 40.3.3 was simply repealed and Brian identified three possible consequences and indeed, I think it is fair to say there could be more and they were first, that the form of abortion legislation would exclusively be a matter for the Oireachtas. The second, that pre-1983 Constitutional, the pre-1983 Constitutional position would revive, including any implied rights of the unborn under the Constitution before 1983 and thirdly, that the rights of a pregnant woman to privacy, to bodily integrity and to autonomy would prevail over many countervailing circumstances, including any rights of the unborn. They are three possible consequences that were identified and Brian indicated that in his opinion a consequence which would be most likely to prevail was the first consequence. That legislation would be exclusively a matter for the Oireachtas but what we feel should be brought to your attention is that the position is not absolutely certain. So there would be implications of a recommendation from the Assembly for a simple repeal of Article 40.3.3 would be uncertain. If Option 1 is selected, the citizens would then go on to vote on Ballot 4A. Ballot 4A would provide recommendations of the Assembly to the Oireachtas about the reasons, if any, for which termination of pregnancy should be lawful in Ireland as well as any gestational limits that should apply. So, the Assembly would be giving their views to the Oireachtas. It's as simple as that. The information would be supplied under Article or sorry, under 5.4A. Now, going on to Option 2 and that's to replace or amend. It would be open the potential for the Constitution to continue to address the right to life of the unborn and/or termination of pregnancy, either exclusively or in conjunction with legislation. This type of change could be done in a number of different ways. For example, an entirely new provision could replace what is already there. That is Article 40.3.3 or alternatively, an amendment could change the wording of the existing text. The text of a replacement provision or amendment could be drafted in a multitude of ways to provide for a range of circumstances and issues. The citizens must recall that it is not the role of the Assembly to draft or suggest replacement provision but rather to provide recommendations. At this point we are considering the substance or text of a replacement, sorry, at this point we are not considering the substance or text of a replacement provision or amendment. A replacement provision or amendment to the Constitution could only be subsequently amended, that is to say altered or changed, by the people in a Referendum. It is important to note that voting for either Option 1 or Option 2 in Draft Ballot 2 may result in an outcome that allows for either liberalization of the current legal regulation of termination of pregnancies in Ireland or alternatively, an outcome which results in the rights of the unborn being given greater protection. So, both scenarios are possible and this is because both legislation enacted in consequence of repeal or, and I want to stress this, depending on its terms, a provision replacing or amending Article 40.3.3 in the Constitution could have either effect. Now, the third option, the final voting option, that's \"prefer not to state an opinion\". This is on the Draft Ballot Paper, as it is important that those who voted in favour of retention of Article 40.3.3 in Ballot 1 are not forced by the Ballot Paper into specifying how the change will be implemented. They are, of course, free to do so regardless of how they voted in Ballot 1 but they are not required to do so nor to abstain from to avoid doing so. Instead they can select the option \"prefer not to state an opinion\". This option might also be selected for a variety of reasons by citizens who voted against the retention of Article 40.3.3 in its current form in Ballot 1. Now, I'm just going to briefly refer to the presentation of the results. A sample results sheet for this Ballot is provided on the screen behind me. Once again it will specify the number of citizens eligible to vote and the number of citizens who voted. The results will provide details of the number of votes cast in respect of Option 1, Option 2 and Prefer not to State an Option. However, for the avoidance of doubt, a majority would be determined by reference to the total votes cast in favour of both Option 1 and Option 2. Before we go on to the next step, I just want to mention one thing arising from the results of Ballot 1. You will recollect that the members present who voted numbered 91 and I'm told that another member will be here in the afternoon and will want to vote on the remaining ballots and what I propose at this stage is asking the members whether they have any objection to that and if they have no objection I would like to -- in other words no objection to the member who is not here at the moment joining in. If they have no objection I'd like them to put up their hands now. So you have no objection. Very good, very good. All right, we're now going to go into private session and this will last for 20 minutes, until ten past one and then we'll have the feedback. So bear in mind what I said this morning in the private session about the round table discussion and all of that and if you have questions write them down and make them available to the Secretariat as soon as possible. Very good. Ten past one we'll resume. As you can see, the stage is occupied. We have our three lawyers once again to assist you in the questions you have and we have Dr. Liz Dunn who is coming up now and I'm going to take the questions. Put up your hands if you have a question. I'll take the question from Table 5 and I presume a copy of it has been given already."

      "context": [
        "CAT BURTON: I do not have a great deal personally. GIRES has some focuses, which we are working on for the coming year. Intersectionality is very much at the forefront of our thoughts at the moment. Personally, I am the chair of Race Equality First, the charity that is the remnant of the old race equality council for south-east Wales. That is a Cardiff-based charity. I also work an awful lot with Diversity Role Models. In that particular role, I go into schools all over the UK to talk to young people about what it means to be transgender and why bullying of colleagues is not a good idea. A lot of the schools I have been to have been in deprived areas of east London that have a large minority ethnic complement of pupils. There are some very particular needs for that community that come along the lines of, “How do you explain that my imam tells me that being transgender is a sin?” I cannot really answer that from the point of view of their imam’s teaching, but I can say that there is no worldwide religion that says hate is a good thing. It very often is a case of being very careful with these minority communities, because they do have transgender members as part of their communities and those transgender members are the most deprived of support of all of us. The last thing they need is the intrusion of the current process in their lives to make it even more difficult than it is.",
        "DR HAMLIN: I just want to reiterate what everyone else has said. The Beaumont Society is a small charity. We do not employ anyone. We are very much a mutual support group and, of course, we support each other as well as we can. Two years can be an unnecessarily long time. It is, after all, an arbitrary period. There is no particular significance of two years. To successfully live in role anyway, one would need to have changed one’s names and documents, like one’s passport, driving licence and so on. There is a lot to do and lots to think about. When I began to live as Jane full time, I knew very quickly that there was no way I was going to go back. I had been hiding this for decades, and suddenly there was this huge weight lifted from my back and I realised this was the real me. I did not need anyone else to tell me and I did not need two years to realise that. Whatever time period is chosen, evidence will have to be provided to prove that you have been doing it for that long and then checked, of course. That creates unnecessary bureaucracy and expense. It is not necessary.",
        "CAT BURTON: This is a brilliant question, actually. When I applied for my gender recognition certificate, my application filled the box that five reams of paper comes in, because part of the requirement for two years of lived experience is to justify it with every single piece of paper that has your name on it for that entire period of time. I sent it off, very carefully prepared, to the gender recognition panel, and I got a nice note back from the secretariat to say I had done their work by sectioning it all into little plastic folders and things. It got knocked back. The reason it got knocked back is that I had sent them two years’ worth of documentation but I had prepared it a month before the date on the application. That final month between the date I had put this package together and the date on the application was not justified by the documents. They would not tell me that. The panel does not give any feedback whatsoever when it knocks back an application but, because I had been on the right side of the secretariat, they said, “It is because the last month of documentation was not there, Cat. If you send it back with the documentation up to the date of the application, it will get through next time,” and it did. Of course, I had to apply again and pay the fee again. That process of justifying those two years is one of the most onerous parts of the entire application. My suggestion would be that it needs a cooling-off period from the date of the application. What it does not need is time before the application. I would strongly suggest that the measure you look at to make sure that this is not done trivially and with no thought is to say, “From the date of the application, we are going to take three months to issue the gender recognition certificate. During those three months, you will be expected to live in role in an unbroken way.” The other real problem with justifying role with documentary evidence arises for young people. The documentary evidence that they sought to justify my two years in role was every pay cheque, tax return, utility bill, mobile phone bill and literally every letter from my employer. Every single piece of paper that comes to somebody with a name on it has to be sent to them to justify that the period of two years is unbroken. That is the thing that they are looking for: that there was no period where, for a month or two, you could not be bothered with this and you just went back to being the old you. Of course, young people are going to struggle immensely to provide documentation that they have been living in role, other than perhaps school reports. Again, I would strongly urge the Committee to consider, yes, making it a period of time but making that period of time actually mean something and be useful. Let us say, arbitrarily, that you accept my recommendation of three months. During that period, you can be dealing with one of the other things that I know we are going to come to later in the agenda, which is spousal veto, and putting in place a different protection for the spouse of somebody who is seeking a gender recognition certificate. Other than a simple veto, you can use this period of time to allow for reflection and discussion.",
        "LUI ASQUITH: Just to add to what Cat has said there, to be clear, Mermaids believes that this requirement, which is often known as real-life experience, is outdated and should be removed. We second the evidential problems that young people specifically have. There are also specific evidential problems for non-binary individuals. To add to that, the whole real-life experience test reinforces stereotypical assumptions around gender, which are unhelpful to everybody. We have to ask, “How does one evidence gender?” Those watching this panel or on this panel who are cisgender could ask themselves, “How would I evidence that I am X gender?” It is hopefully an exercise that will allow you to really engage with what it feels like to have to put forward a test case for you being who you say you are. We believe in self-determination and that any arbitrary lived experience evidence is unnecessary and unnecessarily bureaucratic.",
        "NANCY KELLEY: It is also important to recognise that that period of time is one for which you are leaving trans people open to abuse and discrimination, because of uncontrolled disclosure of the way that they were assigned at birth on their birth certificate. That matters in the context of all of this unnecessary delay. To come back to your previous question, Kim, the Government have an incredible opportunity in terms of banning conversion therapy to do great work for black and Asian trans people in particular. We know that the highest risk populations of conversion therapy are trans people, black people, Asian people and people of colour. Sending a really clear message that all forms of conversion therapy are unacceptable, whether they are religiously or culturally motivated or to do with pseudo-psychotherapy, would be a huge step forward in sending a signal to those communities that young black trans people, Asian trans people and trans people of colour should be respected and valued for who they are.",
        "CAT BURTON: Yes, by all means. “Acquired gender” is certainly not the language that, as far as I know, any of our organisations currently recommends. “Acquired gender” assumes that you were not that gender before you acquired it: that there is a change of gender. In point of fact, all there is for most trans people is a realisation of gender. I have always been Cat. I did not always present as Cat. I did not always know I was Cat. That does not alter the fact that I always was Cat. When I was 14, I dabbled with a young school friend and the two of us dressed as girls. As a result of that, I shied away from transitioning because I looked like what I was: a 14-year-old rugby player in a frock. I put it away in a little tin box at the back of my brain marked “Do not open this box under any circumstances.” It stayed locked until my 50s. Then a trivial thing—it is irrelevant what it was—opened the box, and I realised that you actually only live once and you have to be the best person you can be. Unfortunately, as soon as the box was opened, I realised that most of my life had been camouflage. I wore a beard for most of my adult life. I became an airline pilot and there was nothing more camouflaging than doing that job back in the 1970s. If I had been presenting as the real me back in the 1970s, I would not have got my job. I would not have had my fabulous career. The simple fact of the matter is that I have always been me; I just did not always know it.",
        "BEN BRADLEY: Hello, everybody. I have three questions for you. First, Cat touched earlier on spousal consent. I am interested in how that affects trans people applying for a certificate and whether it should be removed, as well as your view on the counterargument. Some people would argue that there is the possibility of a spouse being trapped in a marriage, where obviously the circumstances have changed a great deal, or that it might force a divorce in a scenario where, perhaps for religious reasons or whatever, people are not comfortable with divorce. I wonder what you make of those arguments and your views on the spousal consent provision overall.",
        "CAT BURTON: I find spousal consent particularly offensive. It has the potential to hold the trans person hostage and I do not think anybody particularly wants that situation. I do, however, strongly support the idea of a requirement for a conversation between two adults, whether that be under legal supervision or other. There is a great argument for honest and fair treatment of the spouse of a trans person who does not wish to remain married. Obviously, the ideal solution is that both people can resolve their differences and remain married but, if that is impossible, the current solution is that that person withholds spousal consent, which can go on indefinitely. If the person does not wish to give consent, they are currently eligible not for a divorce but for an annulment. IN LEGAL TERMS—I am sorry if I am teaching you to suck eggs here—that simply means that it is as if the marriage had never taken place. I do not know of any religious or moral objections to a marriage being annulled. Even Henry VIII had his first marriage annulled rather than a divorce. The simple fact of the matter is that I am not saying somebody has to remain locked into a marriage unless they wish to give consent. All I am saying is that the consent at the moment is hostage taking. There should be a mechanism for everybody to resolve it in an amicable way and there should also be, very firmly, a time limit on how long that spouse can obstruct the issue of a gender recognition certificate. At the moment, the mechanism is that, without spousal consent, you get an interim gender recognition certificate, which does precisely nothing. It is literally a placeholder until such time as the differences are resolved, either by annulment or by somebody coming up with consent at a later date. I am not trying to say that the trans person is the only person here who is important. What I am saying is that both parties are important. They need to treat it like a pair of adults and talk about it, even if that is under legal pressure to do so. That is where my three months come from in the original argument. You may wish to say that three months is not long enough and I will not argue with you on that. The simple fact of the matter is that, after the application, there should be time to discuss this problem, but there should never be a case where it can be blocked for longer than a non-notional period, whether that be three or six months—a sensible and justifiable period of delay after the application.",
        "DR HAMLIN: I believe that all individuals should have autonomy over their own lives. Someone else should not be able to shackle them in this sort of way. The spousal veto is more likely to cause friction when they are probably already under severe strain. I agree with Cat that there needs to be mechanisms so that people can talk this through in a positive and constructive way. I am not talking particularly about the GRA here, but there should be counselling support available for the spouse and the family to help them understand why someone wants to transition. In our experience, there is no such support service. Our GP was able to organise some counselling for my wife but it is not a standard procedure. It is just another bureaucratic complication that adds to the cost of the process. My own wife found the declaration process unnecessary and intrusive, but agreed to make it because she wanted to support me. We were in this together. Fortunately, my application for the GRC coincided with us updating our wills and the solicitor threw in a free spousal declaration and my declaration as part of the deal. He was very happy—I think it was the first one he had done—to do mine, but he felt a bit embarrassed that he had to go through the same procedure for my wife. He thought it was unnecessary as well, and she obviously did too. As I say, she was very happy to do it because she wanted it to be successful.",
        "NANCY KELLEY: I really support everything that both Cat and Jane have said. There are a few things to add. The original reason or rationale behind spousal veto was in part to do with homophobia; it was a relic of pre-equal marriage times, based on the assumption that finding yourself as a woman married to another woman without meaning to was always an undesirable outcome. When equal marriage was introduced in Scotland, they removed spousal consent at the same time for that reason. It is important to have that context. In terms of the concerns that I know are often raised about spousal consent, for people who no longer wish to be in a marriage, the obvious answer is to seek a divorce for whatever reason, including this. I do not mean to trivialise divorce—I have been married to my wife very happily for 14 years—but that is the obvious solution. I know that sometimes people have raised concerns around making it easier for people who are in abusive relationships to leave in a way that is supported, and for people whose religious and cultural beliefs make divorce inaccessible or harder to access. There are a couple of things to think about here. First, with both of those scenarios, the overwhelming majority of couples for whom that is an issue—abuse within the couple, or religious or cultural prohibitions against divorce—are straight and cisgendered couples. The GRA is not really a great mechanism for dealing with that as a social issue. Exactly as Cat and Jane have pointed out, there are lots of ways, if it is required to deal with it specifically in the GRA, to decouple it from a veto situation. Having an annulment on the grounds of a GRC being issued would be the most obvious thing, as opposed to a delay in the issuing of a GRC. That would achieve the same protections for those people who were trapped in marriages they did not want to be in and, for a range of reasons, found it difficult to exit.",
        "LUI ASQUITH: It increases the risk of coercive control within a relationship, just to repeat that point. I know Nancy alluded to it.",
        "BEN BRADLEY: My second question is about the gender recognition panel. We have touched on it before. What is your view of the role that it plays? Some people have argued that it is inaccessible and too secretive. There are various issues around it.",
        "LUI ASQUITH: Looking from the perspective of a trans individual, what we hear at Mermaids is that people do not really understand who it is on the panel. There is no real transparency around the process and that creates a barrier, because people do not want to have to evidence to what feels like a panel of strangers, and objectively is a group of strangers, matters that strike right through the heart of their personal life and private life. That is what we are dealing with here. We are talking about incredibly personal issues. Having to disclose them to what is a panel of strangers can serve as a huge issue around transparency. Of course, a product of that is not knowing whether to trust or not understanding what it is that you are having to subject yourself to. We hear at Mermaids that that is a huge anxiety within the process.",
        "NANCY KELLEY: I am just going to say a couple of things briefly, because Jane’s and Cat’s testimony on this is the most important, in a sense. One of the things that Cat has alluded to is really important: that you do not know why you get rejected when you get rejected. It is a complete black box. You put an input in, and then an answer comes out and you do not know why. That is really important. The other thing I wanted to flag, which will perhaps get expanded later, is that there is a real issue with the way in which this very untransparent panel has experienced scope creep or involved scope creep. One of the things at the heart of how intrusive, difficult and off-putting this process is is the level of detail that the panel requires in medical reports. Those things are not required on the face of the Act but the panel works in a way that is dealing with these incredibly intrusive medical reporting processes. It is simultaneously asking you the most personal things for no good reason and totally unaccountable to you as an individual.",
        "DR HAMLIN: I am sure the people on the panel are worthy people who want to do their best for those who make applications but, as people have said, we have no idea who they are, what their qualifications are and, as Cat has been saying, why my application was approved and hers was not first time. Like Cat, I did not find it easy to collect all the necessary evidence that I needed. I have a gender-neutral title. When I changed my name, I did not change my initials. We had to find the utility bills and, of course, my wife pays half the utility bills anyway. We were living in the same house for over 20 years and had been together as respected members of the community, as they say. What must it be like for younger people who live at home or have no settled accommodation? It must be incredibly difficult. It is unfortunate. We would like to know more about it.",
        "BEN BRADLEY: It needs more openness.",
        "CAT BURTON: We do know a bit about how the gender recognition panel is constituted. They are retired judges. It is a very nice little earner for judges in retirement. We are not allowed to know who is on the gender recognition panel, nor do we get any feedback from them. My personal view is that the panel should simply be disbanded. All we are asking for is a very simple bureaucratic process; it should be no more than that. In fact, moving online, as it has, would make a simple bureaucratic process ideal, because all you really need to do is have a look and say, “Are all the required statutory declarations there? Has the fee, whatever it may be, been paid? Yes, approve or, no, disapprove of this application.” It does not need a huge pile of evidence. In fact, one of the main reasons why it is expensive and requires a panel is that they have to sift through a box of papers that is nearly a foot deep. If you got rid of all the bureaucratic requirements and simply made it a box-ticking exercise, an office staff could make sure that all the boxes were ticked. I am a pilot. I apply to the CAA for licences on a regular basis and it now has an online process. You upload the documents from a flight skill test, or something like that. Within about 24 hours they have had a look at what has arrived in your file, they tick “yes” and the licence gets sent. It should be no more complex or expensive than that. There should quite simply be no panel. It does not require learned judges to approve of all this. It just needs for somebody to check that all the required answers are on the documentation and then say yes.",
        "BEN BRADLEY: I have one final question I want to ask of you, Nancy, on the basis that it cropped up from your written evidence. You and I spoke about this before last year, and I agreed with a lot of the stuff, particularly around bureaucracy and the complexity of it all. The thing that perhaps we could not agree on, which gets to the heart of the Act and the discussion around it, is the suggestion you put in your written evidence that the Equality Act should include gender identity instead of gender reassignment, and perhaps remove things like single-sex space exemptions. That seems to be the heart of the conflict, if that is the right word, around all of this. Do you see the argument and conflict, if you think there is one, around doing that and the rights of women based on sex under the Equality Act? If you do see that, how do you suggest resolving that conversation?",
        "NANCY KELLEY: I will give that a go. There were quite a few questions rolled into one there, but all really good. The Equality Act protects on the basis of both sex and gender identity. The protections for trans people and the gender identity protections are not attached to whether someone has a gender recognition certificate, and that is really important for a ton of reasons, including the way in which the two pieces of legislation do and do not interact. It is really important to say that we do not advocate for the removal of the single-sex exemptions in the Equality Act. When the Equality Act was first introduced, Stonewall did. That was because we were worried that they would be applied in a really blanket way and would be used to wholesale exclude trans women from many single-sex spaces. We know that that has not been the case. The bar set in the Equality Act, which is that trans women and trans men—although it is mostly used around trans women—access to women’s spaces should only be restricted as a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim, is very high. There has to be a very specific set of reasons to exclude trans women from single-sex spaces. Although we dearly wish that no single-sex spaces wished to exclude trans women, trans men or non-binary people, we also recognise that, for the minority of spaces that want to, it is probably not a particularly safe service for those trans people to access. The main concerns that come up around access to single-sex spaces—and I am going to talk primarily around women’s spaces, if that is okay, because that is how this argument takes place—cluster around a few different issues. The first that I would really like to address, because I know that it was addressed in previous evidence, is the idea that trans women are unsafe and therefore it is unsafe for trans women to be in, for instance, a domestic abuse setting or any other single-sex setting. There is no evidence of this. I know that previous witnesses have pointed to a very specific study around offending and trans people. I would really like to address what is in that Swedish study because it does not say what it was represented as saying. Indeed, the author, Dhejne, has publicly explained many times that that is not what the study says. That study, which tends to be relied on when people say trans women are not safe, looks at two cohorts of trans people. One is an older cohort of people who transitioned between 1973 and 1989, and the other is a younger cohort of people who transitioned between 1989 and 2003. In that first cohort, the people who transitioned quite a long time ago, it finds similar levels of criminal convictions—all types of convictions, so not specifically sex crimes or any of the things that it is sometimes represented as saying—for trans women and cis men. In the younger group, so everybody who transitioned after 1989, which is quite a long time ago, that is not the case. Trans women do not have higher levels of criminal convictions in that cohort since 1989. The author themselves says that their assumption is that, as trans people have become more socially accepted and more able to have employment in mainstream settings, they have not been pushed into subsistence and low-level criminal activity because of poverty and marginalisation, and that the elevated rates of criminal convictions are most likely attributable to that. It is really important to say that there is no evidence that trans women represent any kind of real-world safety risk to cis women. The other thing that sometimes gets talked about is the idea that this somehow takes resources away from cis women like me, particularly in the violence against women and girls sector. Again, it is really important to remember that this is a tiny population and a grossly underfunded sector. This month, the Government announced a £90 million investment into the violence against women and girls sector. It is incredibly welcome but it is nowhere near enough. The estimate is that around £393 million is needed for refuges and other life-saving services. It is really disappointing that publicly, and sometimes in the media, trans people and trans women specifically get blamed for this, including by institutions that are not really interested in violence against women and girls. It is this pitting of one vulnerable group of women against another vulnerable group of women. We are really side-stepping all of those important things about the Government stripping back funding or there not being enough funding in the context of austerity for violence against women and girls services. We are really keen to focus on the fact that there are a great many violence against women and girls services that are explicitly trans-inclusive, a vast majority that are trans-inclusive by default and just get on with it, and a minority for which that is deeply inimical. We know that being trans-inclusive in those services can work really well and our perspective is how we can support more services to work in that way. Sorry, that was a bit of a long answer.",

        "CHAIR: Okay everybody so I'm going to just be the moderator for this session. We have rapporteurs from each of the 10 breakout groups and each rapporteur is going to present the three key messages from their groups which the groups have agreed they want to bring forward to the wider Assembly today. And we're recording this feedback session as you know and it will be uploaded on our website. And I want to add my thanks to those of you for agreeing to step up and be the rapporteur today. So without any further ado I'm going to call on you in the order of the ten tables and that means I'm going to start with breakout group 1. So can you tell us whatever messages your three messages from your group please?",
        "BREAKOUT GROUP 1: On the issue of quotas our group was very divided we came up with three possible solutions one was voluntary quotas like we'll say the male champions of change which we saw in the last video that were shown. We thought that was recommended I'd say by all of us. A short share burst of a quota increase was also discussed we'll say not up to the 50 percent but up a little for more women to be in roles to inspire more to follow in them and then maybe a gradual phased-in quota up a few percent every year. That was how we were on quotas and we'll say then but on the voluntary thing along with men champions of change we thought that if gender equality is good for business or for political parties they'll embrace it themselves. Then for our second point was school curriculum we thought gender balance should be promoted in schools we'll say for career guidance civics at the moment well I don't know about at the moment but certainly when we were in school women were steered one way men the other way. We said in single gender schools you wouldn't get metal work, woodwork subjects and you wouldn't get home economics other stuff in the male only school that it should be more options should be open to females to send them that they can do anything men can do and it should be done in schools this way. And the third point was mentorship and leadership programs we'll say to outside of mainstream education where women can be guided towards leadership roles in whatever it may be local politics and then as a stepping stone onto mainstream politics or even in local clubs local associations with the aims of getting on to boards getting to the higher positions.",
        "CHAIR: Okay thank you very much breakout group one, next I come to breakout group two.",
        "BREAKOUT GROUP 2: So there's a little bit of overlap so the three areas that we've kind of selected for feedback and for recommendations I suppose priority areas were so quotas and we had a discussion about quotas versus targets. Second area was the education system and a third one then was about recognizing the diverse identities of women and especially paying attention to supporting leadership from women in marginalized groups so I'll just go through each of these. So on the quotas area and we had quite a healthy discussion both morning afternoon on that but basically we're far I think the group can down very much for quotas as opposed to targets which are aspirational you know. And the idea that they would be like very firmly linked to receipt of public funding with a kind of a sanction or a penalty if they're not achieved and this would be public funding of political parties but also bodies in the arts, media, entertainment, sports etc. areas as well. And that it should also be about not just about promoting women's participation but supporting women into leadership levels that this is what it should also so be about so it's not just about having women on boards it's about having them in leadership positions within those and that there should be a structure to monitor this to report on this and then to adopt the remedial measures so that it's not just left there as a target but it's actually you know shifted and changed in relation to practice so that was the quotas one. The education system was seen as being really important in its own right and also in terms of the influence it has in wider society from primary school upwards particularly and so a couple of areas came up on that subject choice; the edge of quality of the education materials; de-genderizing the curriculum and the materials in terms of things like career guidance but also for example exposing boys particularly girls in this case to for example political life as a career and it should be you know done in a way to inform and encourage girls and boys alike you know away from a kind of a stereotypical kind of approach to education and life and that and that this would have an effect on wider society as well. The third area then was about recognizing the diverse identities of women and including kind of dedicated initiatives in particular to support participation and leadership from women from marginalized groups and promoting their participation so within any gender equality measure that that needs to be a dedicated specific strand.",
        "CHAIR: Okay thanks very much breakout group two next I come to breakout group three.",
        "BREAKOUT GROUP 3: So much similar to my previous two speakers we focus on three points first one being education then removing barriers and finally accountability so what we said about education was education must be in the school, college and throughout the person working life and also in politics and in the wider private business to cover things like unconscious bias, stereotypical bias and then policies procedures and systems to be I suppose updated from a gender equality point of view. And within that we discussed as well quote the quota system. What we said there is that the gender quotas must be meaningful must be tracked and must be accountable but also I suppose it's a balance of the right person skill set for the job as against the quota so we were tending to say yes you want five directors five male five female but it could be six or four depending on the skill set required so we wouldn't go down that directly. Secondly then on removing barriers politically moving barriers in the political landscape is for women to progress in politics there must be grants, there must be maternity, there must be benefits, there must be all the supports necessary that already exist in public life or in private corporate life must be in public life as well and also the issue around social media and cyber bullying which is a serious problem particularly for women and that they're protected in that. And finally then we said our third point would be accountability from the top board and down to through the organizations again in private and public life.",
        "CHAIR: Thank you very much breakout group three it's interesting to see the way certain themes are coming through from each group and then where there are differences between each group as well so let's hear next from breakout group four please.",
        "BREAKOUT GROUP 4: Yeah so we've much the similar points actually from as the other three groups so yeah so our first point that we wanted to bring was quotas so we said that we'd have a quota of 40-60 with an aim as to having 50-50 like as like not aspirational but having a minimum quota as 40-60 but alongside that it couldn't work in just as like just throwing in a quota that it would have to be alongside the supports of child care for both women and men going into politics to make politics more gender more accessible to everyone as such as well as like parties being would be penalized if they weren't obeying just they are helping the candidates that they put forward. Another point that we came up with was we wanted to phase out the funding of single gender schools just to make like just to start from the ground up as well as the quotas on the top like leadership positions in politics. And our third suggestion that we wanted to bring forward is along with education as well so I know a few of the other speakers have already spoken about education but we wanted education from on a schools level to include civic engagement and like being an active member in society from like primary school level up as well as role models training and mentorship programs. And funding in like at the community level organizations separate from sporting organizations that would encourage more training and development of all members of society so just even like boys and girls should be for everyone to be a more active member of society in the hope that we'd get rid of like stereotypes and make it normal for I don't know for it won't be such like a boy's elitist club of politics in the end and like and in leadership positions that everyone has the opportunity to reach the top as such so yeah there were three recommendations.",
        "CHAIR: Thank you very much I think it's an interesting idea to encourage everybody to participate in society more broadly from an early age that would be great if that could happen. Next I come to group five and the rapporteur there is breakout group five.",
        "BREAKOUT GROUP 5: In our group there was a very clear agreement that there is a need for change accelerated disruptive change to the system we were all very inspired by the last Australian video and just the attitude in it. That gender inequality is a symptom of organizational deficiency and needs to be addressed by men and women. Quotas was we there was very clear agreement that we need quotas at national and local government level and in all public bodies. Quotas need to be measurable, transparent, accountable, measurable targets on gender equality and the meeting of those targets is linked to funding. We would like to see a Minister for gender inequality or for gender equality rather yes a minister for gender equality specifically with responsibility for developing a strategic plan in all sectors to develop a systemic change and things that basic things that would come under that were like parental leave, maternity leave for public representatives we felt it was just beyond belief that that doesn't exist, the gender pay gap and cyber accountability on how women are represented or how young people are targeted all of that would come under that. And our third one was education and awareness. So awareness raising for everybody on the cultural and historical gender bias and how we have got to where we are. And for education to become gender neutral with gender neutral career guidance with education from an early age on politics and leadership."

So the first question would be where it would go from there but if it got to the stage of drafting, then my understanding is that drafting would be done through the Departments and facilities in Government that are responsible for drafting Constitutional Referenda. So what you would be giving in your 4 Ballot would be an indication as to the reasons and circumstances in which you think the Constitution should be amended in the various ways but it would then be a matter of drawing up wording for a proposed Referendum, a matter for the drafters attached to working with your office committee and the public generally. I don't know if the Chair has any other thoughts on that?",

Thank you?",
        "DR. DOYLE: Okay. So I'll take those questions. First of all, obviously what comes out of here is recommendations to the Oireachtas for the Oireachtas to consider, okay but if we take the question as if Option 1 is carried, in terms of if there were to be a Referendum carried in terms of Option 1, that wouldn't create any obligation on the Oireachtas to create new legislation. The existing legislation for the 2013 Act would continue in force but the Oireachtas would be free to change that legislation at any time it wanted, in any way that it wanted because the Oireachtas would have full power to regulate issues around termination of pregnancy and so on and I think it follows on from that that there's no question of a timeframe between the Referendum having to pass legislation. In response to question 2, as if Option 2 was carried. Again, does this mean that the specific reasons for termination go into the Constitution, yes.",
        "JORDAN: Jordan from Table 14. I just wanted to ask a question of clarification I suppose on the wording of Option 1 and 2. Clarification regarding the distinction between the termination of pregnancy versus the word abortion because on a number of occasions the Assembly received information from both advocates and professionals drawing distinctions between either phrase, most memorably Dr. Angelo Libertino, a staunch anti-abortion advocate, said that he had no issue with termination of pregnancy because the unborn might survive outside of the womb. I suppose termination of pregnancy also allows for the 2013 Protection of Life during Pregnancy Act, so it is not unconstitutional because it's a termination of pregnancy and not an abortion. So, I was wondering could there be some, I suppose, legal clarification on the difference between the words and/or medical clarification or input. Thank you?",
        "DR. WALSH: Thanks very much. I'll take that question for you. I suppose just to give you a sense of where we arrived at the choice of terminology for the draft wording. We were influenced by the fact that the 2013 Act uses the phrase Termination of Pregnancy and also in consultation with our medical colleagues on the panel, that in medical practice the word abortion is generally not used and in terms of your question about the constitutionality of the 2013 Act, I suppose it's important to note that neither the 2013 Act itself nor the case on which it's based, the X case, expressly deals with the issue of gestational limits. So it's not to say that there isn't the possibility that those might be implicit but it has never been expressly dealt with, either on the face of the legislation or in the case but as you'll see when you move on to looking at the next draft ballots, there is scope for differentiation in terms of gestational limits on the different grounds that are being put to you. So, I think we definitely see the point that's being made about the potential for confusion in terms of the use of terminology. So, what I'd be suggesting if it was something that would be satisfactory for that table and anyone else in the room who shares the view, would be that we on the group would have a look at that wording overnight and before we would come to ballot 4, be able to come back to you with some discussion on whether that wording works appropriately or not. For the purposes of Ballot 3, we're using the word 'Termination of Pregnancies', that phrase in quite general terms to cover the issue more broadly. So, I don't think it is of crucial importance at this stage but certainly I think we do need to look at it before Stage 4. I think it's an important point that has been raised. Liz, do you want to add anything on that?",

The issue that women face when they go to market—angels or whatever—for loans over £25,000 is perhaps that it is unregulated, and we know that they are much more likely to be asked for personal guarantees. This is where the gender pay gap, and the fact they have less high-value assets themselves comes into play, so that creates a barrier there, too. Perhaps having the British Business Bank offer higher value loans where women would not be required to provide those personal guarantees—such as their homes—might be useful. We also have to be careful that we do not place the onus on women to do even more work; that we are not saying to women, 'It is okay, guys, you can sit back and relax because we will get these women investors in and they can fund the women entrepreneurs.' There is potential advantage to saying, 'Let us have so much of British Business Bank funding ring-fenced for women. Let us perhaps revisit public and corporate procurement policies, so that a certain value of contracts is potentially ring-fenced for women.' I am director and founder of the Charter for Inclusive Entrepreneurship, and we are trying to create a more inclusive ecosystem.

THAT IS WHAT WE NEED TO CHANGE, AND WE CHANGE THAT THROUGH TALKING THE LANGUAGE OF PROFIT. WE HAVE TALKED A LOT ABOUT MENTORING AND WHAT WOMEN CAN DO FOR OTHER FEMALE ENTREPRENEURS. I DO A LOT OF THAT AND I, PERSONALLY, INVEST A LOT IN BACKING FEMALE ENTREPRENEURS. HONESTLY, MY MAIN PIECE OF ADVICE TO THEM IS TO JUST TALK UNASHAMEDLY ABOUT MONEY. ASK FOR MONEY, TALK ABOUT PROFIT AND FOCUS ON MAKING IT. THAT WOULD BE THE ADVICE THAT I WOULD GIVE TO ANYONE AND THE ADVICE THAT I WOULD GIVE TO THE ROOM.",
        "CATHERINE FOOKES: IT IS SUCH AN INTERESTING DISCUSSION TODAY; I HAVE LOVED IT. LAST WEEK WAS SPRING STATEMENT WEEK. DEBBIE, WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE LIKED TO HAVE SEEN IN THE SPRING STATEMENT TO SUPPORT FEMALE ENTREPRENEURS? AT THIS POINT, BECAUSE THIS IS THE LAST QUESTION, IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE THAT WE HAVE NOT TALKED ABOUT TODAY? YOU HAVE ALL MADE VARIOUS DIFFERENT RECOMMENDATIONS, BUT IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE THAT YOU WOULD LIKE US TO KNOW ABOUT THAT COULD REALLY SUPPORT WOMEN BUSINESSES?",
        "DEBBIE WOSSKOW: THANK YOU, AND THANKS FOR THE QUESTION. I FEEL LIKE I AM GOING TO SAY TWO THINGS. ONE IS TO REPEAT AD NAUSEUM THE POINT THAT I HAVE BEEN MAKING, WHICH IS WHAT WOULD I HAVE LIKED TO HAVE SEEN? I THINK THE CHANCELLOR IS AWARE OF THIS. I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE SEEN A CONVERSATION WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ABOUT ENSURING THAT PART OF THE CAPITAL THAT THEY ARE DEPLOYING IN THE UK IS TO FEMALE INVESTORS. I THINK THAT IS WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT’S REMIT TO BE REALLY CLEAR AND FOCUSED ON THAT. I WONDER ABOUT QUOTAS; I AM UNASHAMEDLY FOR THEM. THE ONLY THING THAT HAS CHANGED THE HISTORY OF BUSINESS FEMINISM HAS BEEN THE 30% CLUB AND MERVYN DAVIES’ WORK ON WOMEN ON BOARDS AND THAT IS NOW A THING, RIGHT?",
        "CATHERINE FOOKES: YES.",
        "DEBBIE WOSSKOW: I SIT ON VARIOUS BOARDS—CHANNEL 4 AND OTHERS. CHANNEL 4 IS A COMPLETELY DIVERSE BOARD WITH A FEMALE CEO, AND IT CERTAINLY WAS NOT 15 YEARS AGO. SO, I AM PRO QUOTAS. THE ECF DEPLOYS ITS CAPITAL THROUGH GENDER GUIDELINES. STEPHEN WOULD HAVE A BETTER SENSE THAN I AS TO EXACTLY HOW THEY HAVE MADE THAT HAPPEN, BUT OUR EUROPEAN COUNTERPARTS DO THAT. WE SHOULD BE AWARE THAT IT IS BEING DONE ELSEWHERE AND IS GENUINELY HAVING AN IMPACT ON THE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL THAT IS GOING TO BACK FEMALE INVESTORS AND, THEREFORE, TO FEMALE-POWERED BUSINESSES. EVERYTHING TO DO WITH THE CODE IS VOLUNTARY. I AM SOUNDING LIKE A COMPLETE DRACONIAN NIGHTMARE, BUT I WOULD MAKE IT LESS VOLUNTARY. I REALLY WOULD MAKE IT A REQUIREMENT THAT INVESTORS HAVE TO REPORT ON THIS STUFF. AT THE MOMENT, THEY DO NOT HAVE TO. IF THEY HAVE TO, THAT IS HOW WE SEE SHIFTS.",
        "CHAIR: I feel this is not at all spring statement worthy because, goodness knows, there was a lot of other stuff to cover off, but we are asking the right questions and this group should continue to ask questions about systemic change because, otherwise, I worry that anything that happens will not move the needle.

Thank you very much.",
        "DR MARKS: At Swansea University.",
        "CHAIR: At Swansea University, yes, which has made Catherine very happy, as well as every other member of the Committee, but especially Catherine. Thank you very much and welcome, and I am going to hand over to Kirith.",
        "KIRITH ENTWISTLE: My first question is for you, Dr Marks. In your evidence, you challenged the assumption that more women starting businesses is automatically better. Could you tell us a little about some of your concerns around encouraging more women into entrepreneurship?",
        "DR MARKS: Absolutely. It is important to say that I am not against women entrepreneurs per se, but I suppose that my research and the evidence that I have presented to the Committee looks at some of the other aspects of women entrepreneurs’ lives and experiences. One of the things that my evidence shows is that women find it very difficult to make sustaining incomes for themselves from running their own business to the extent that it is quite doubtful that most women starting a business are going to be able to replicate the kind of income they might get in the market in employment. Therefore, it would be great if the taskforce is thinking about the overall impact that encouraging women into entrepreneurship might have on questions like women’s financial equality and long-term financial futures, as well as just simply things like the gender pay gap.",
        "KIRITH ENTWISTLE: We have talked a lot about the gender pay gap, and I imagine that is one of the elements that you mean. For the wider panel as well: to what extent do discussions on supporting female entrepreneurs focus too much on start-ups and not enough on the growth and sustainability element that Dr Marks mentioned there?",
        "DR TREANOR: That is really a very good question, and probably an accurate observation because when the prevailing discourse is around women’s under-representation as entrepreneurs, it naturally then leads the discussions and thinking about how we get more women into entrepreneurship, which is obviously very quantity focused, and perhaps does not pay due regard to the quality aspect, as a natural outworking of that. What we really need to also consider, and something that my research would suggest, is that there is a very big difference between the quality of entrepreneurship and being able to make a good living and a good return to the economy. The UK has quite a high rate of people living in self-employed poverty, so when we are encouraging people into entrepreneurship where they have the potential to generate a suitable living return, it is important to consider that we do it responsibly and mindfully. But there needs to be a better balance because we really need to focus on how those women who are in business can then be encouraged and supported to have sustainable businesses they can grow, which we know is a challenge.",
        "PROFESSOR STEPHAN: I would concur with that; we need to focus on all three elements—start-up, sustainability and growth—which all have their own challenges. It is really good that we are talking about growth, but when we talk about start-ups I feel we are not necessarily talking about sustaining entrepreneurship and making it work for women. I would completely concur that for a developed economy, the UK seems to have a lot of necessity entrepreneurship, especially women’s necessity entrepreneurship. We see from analysis of the UK household data that women who leave their jobs to start a business, which is normally considered opportunity entrepreneurship, do not get the same uplift in wellbeing as men, so it does not seem to be a positive choice. So, all the rhetoric around it being a fulfilling career and being able to design your own job and organisation, which seems very attractive, does not seem to bear out. We are not talking enough about this in terms of specific managerial capacity. You need to do everything as an entrepreneur, and it is really challenging. There is a huge psychological barrier to taking on the first employee, which is also something we are not necessarily looking at enough because once you become more than a one-woman business, you can then focus more on strategy, including growth, for instance, but then you also have additional responsibilities to manage, which is not so easy, and there is a risk discussion in that as well. I will stop there.",
        "KIRITH ENTWISTLE: My next question then is how do we better support established female-led businesses so that they can be sustainable and also grow? That question is for anyone.",
        "DR TREANOR: I could give you a shopping list. As we heard very much from the first panel, a key perennial issue is that what we have seen is very fragmented, short-term delivery, with an evaporation of funding and potential loss of great expertise and support from the business support sector because of a lack of funding in recent times. We need to have an infrastructure in place and to have this on the agenda over the longer term. If we look at what they are doing in other jurisdictions, we should have a women’s business enterprise development committee or something with oversight. We need to mandate gender disaggregated data, and we need to have intersectional aspects highlighted within that as well. We need business start-up and growth support, and when any fund is accessing public money, it would be relatively easy to not just require the data but to require that they engage in sponsorship. The first panel talked a bit about mentoring; we could say that we do not need to fix the women, we need to start giving women more training and getting investors to perhaps do a bit of homework. But what we could do is say, for all these white men—business angels are something like 93% white men—accessing public money, they could undertake to provide sponsorship to women. Because, as opposed to mentoring someone and giving some advice and then moving on, the sponsorship would then require active advocacy within closed doors and would enable those weaknesses in women’s networks to be overcome through those warm contacts and introductions to potential investors. The other weakness in women’s networks is that they do not have a large proportion of high-net-worth people in their networks: women’s networks tend to consist of friends and family. If you have women from ethnic minority backgrounds or low-income backgrounds, they cannot tap up their friends and family for the same degree of initial funding support. This constrains early access to finance, and my research shows that is really important for accessing subsequent grant support and, indeed, investment finance.",
        "PROFESSOR STEPHAN: The Help to Grow scheme was already mentioned, and there is value in these small business development programmes. Currently they are very focused on growth, but a question to be asked is whether they could also be focused on sustainability. They work well and are typically taking place over an extended period of time, let us say almost a year. You have points of meeting in person, focused on certain topics—marketing, leadership—you name it. There is a lot of peer exchange, so you are building networks through the programme, which are actually lasting quite a long time. Some initial ones were created by the Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses. There is overall robust evidence that they work really well. Aside from the growth funds, which are important, I wonder whether there could be something focused on sustainability. Also, because some of those are clearly Government-sponsored, could we not ask for quotas in those? I am a bit hesitant as I am not quite sure whether it would make sense to set one up just for women. There are both pros and cons. You do not want it to transpire that, 'Oh, the women need fixing, so they need their own space,' but actually, maybe there are some common sharing and problems. I could not find any evidence whether women-only or mixed is better.",
        "DR MARKS: I have certainly seen some evidence from my experience of women-only networks that the problem can be that women cannot use them to then develop more instrumentally useful networks to access those high-net-worth individuals and things. I have spoken to women who actually talk about them as starter networks, that they are going to have their women’s-only group as a starter, and they are going to get a sense of the lay of the land and then move up to a mixed one. Peer-to-peer support is a really positive thing for people, but it can also be a bit of a double-edged sword in that they keep each other going and give each other support when maybe they should just say, 'Come on, call it a day.' So, you often get reinforcing networks through these peer-to-peer networks. The one thing, when you are talking about start-up, and moving from that start-up to growth position, is the amount of money that is often offered in these start-up loans companies.",
        "SPEAKER_NAME: The maximum is £25,000, and that is brilliant, and I know that they have given out over £1 billion worth of loans, so we are talking about 400,000 or 500,000 out of the whole lot of women entrepreneurs. However, £25,000 is really a very small amount of money to start a business. If you think what the average income is nowadays, that is barely going to buy you a year’s worth of your salary, and then you have all those other things on top of that. So, you are setting people up to fail almost from the start when you are only offering them that amount of money. I had an email just today from one of the training enterprise support networks that I follow. I do not think they will mind me saying it is Allia, which is quite a big provider of enterprise training support and some of the Help to Grow schemes here in London and the south-east. It was talking about a programme that it had helped deliver in Tower Hamlets saying it had about 100 potential entrepreneurs through, and they had given them £2,500 each, which is not a lot of money in anybody’s book, and it is certainly not going to buy a lot in Tower Hamlets, regardless of where you are. That is really one of the issues with the start-up culture that we have developed, which has so many positive narratives, but then there are these other things that are happening."

First of all on the quota system well we recognized a society such as Sweden the norm gender equality is the norm and because it is a norm they don't actually use a quota system into parliament nevertheless we propose that the accountability of political parties to meet gender quotas be expanded to include local government and that potential independent candidates be financially encouraged to reflect this ethos. Secondly in terms of education that the time spent currently given to religious education be replaced by social policy and health education that this education be provided to children from national school to leaving cert with the potential of developing a leaving cert subject from it and making it a point including it on the points system for testing. And that religious information on religion be provided as part of cultural elements of social policy. And finally that social media platforms be held accountable for misinformation and disinformation on their platforms and that traits of sexual gender-based violence be prosecuted as a matter of course.",
      "speaker": "BREAKOUT GROUP 9",
      "context": [
        "CHAIR: Okay everybody so I'm going to just be the moderator for this session. We have rapporteurs from each of the 10 breakout groups and each rapporteur is going to present the three key messages from their groups which the groups have agreed they want to bring forward to the wider Assembly today. And we're recording this feedback session as you know and it will be uploaded on our website. And I want to add my thanks to those of you for agreeing to step up and be the rapporteur today. So without any further ado I'm going to call on you in the order of the ten tables and that means I'm going to start with breakout group 1. So can you tell us whatever messages your three messages from your group please?",
        "BREAKOUT GROUP 1: On the issue of quotas our group was very divided we came up with three possible solutions one was voluntary quotas like we'll say the male champions of change which we saw in the last video that were shown. We thought that was recommended I'd say by all of us. A short share burst of a quota increase was also discussed we'll say not up to the 50 percent but up a little for more women to be in roles to inspire more to follow in them and then maybe a gradual phased-in quota up a few percent every year. That was how we were on quotas and we'll say then but on the voluntary thing along with men champions of change we thought that if gender equality is good for business or for political parties they'll embrace it themselves. Then for our second point was school curriculum we thought gender balance should be promoted in schools we'll say for career guidance civics at the moment well I don't know about at the moment but certainly when we were in school women were steered one way men the other way. We said in single gender schools you wouldn't get metal work, woodwork subjects and you wouldn't get home economics other stuff in the male only school that it should be more options should be open to females to send them that they can do anything men can do and it should be done in schools this way. And the third point was mentorship and leadership programs we'll say to outside of mainstream education where women can be guided towards leadership roles in whatever it may be local politics and then as a stepping stone onto mainstream politics or even in local clubs local associations with the aims of getting on to boards getting to the higher positions.",
        "CHAIR: Okay thank you very much breakout group one, next I come to breakout group two.",
        "BREAKOUT GROUP 2: So there's a little bit of overlap so the three areas that we've kind of selected for feedback and for recommendations I suppose priority areas were so quotas and we had a discussion about quotas versus targets. Second area was the education system and a third one then was about recognizing the diverse identities of women and especially paying attention to supporting leadership from women in marginalized groups so I'll just go through each of these. So on the quotas area and we had quite a healthy discussion both morning afternoon on that but basically we're far I think the group can down very much for quotas as opposed to targets which are aspirational you know. And the idea that they would be like very firmly linked to receipt of public funding with a kind of a sanction or a penalty if they're not achieved and this would be public funding of political parties but also bodies in the arts, media, entertainment, sports etc. areas as well. And that it should also be about not just about promoting women's participation but supporting women into leadership levels that this is what it should also so be about so it's not just about having women on boards it's about having them in leadership positions within those and that there should be a structure to monitor this to report on this and then to adopt the remedial measures so that it's not just left there as a target but it's actually you know shifted and changed in relation to practice so that was the quotas one. The education system was seen as being really important in its own right and also in terms of the influence it has in wider society from primary school upwards particularly and so a couple of areas came up on that subject choice; the edge of quality of the education materials; de-genderizing the curriculum and the materials in terms of things like career guidance but also for example exposing boys particularly girls in this case to for example political life as a career and it should be you know done in a way to inform and encourage girls and boys alike you know away from a kind of a stereotypical kind of approach to education and life and that and that this would have an effect on wider society as well. The third area then was about recognizing the diverse identities of women and including kind of dedicated initiatives in particular to support participation and leadership from women from marginalized groups and promoting their participation so within any gender equality measure that that needs to be a dedicated specific strand.",
        "CHAIR: Okay thanks very much breakout group two next I come to breakout group three.",
        "BREAKOUT GROUP 3: So much similar to my previous two speakers we focus on three points first one being education then removing barriers and finally accountability so what we said about education was education must be in the school, college and throughout the person working life and also in politics and in the wider private business to cover things like unconscious bias, stereotypical bias and then policies procedures and systems to be I suppose updated from a gender equality point of view. And within that we discussed as well quote the quota system. What we said there is that the gender quotas must be meaningful must be tracked and must be accountable but also I suppose it's a balance of the right person skill set for the job as against the quota so we were tending to say yes you want five directors five male five female but it could be six or four depending on the skill set required so we wouldn't go down that directly. Secondly then on removing barriers politically moving barriers in the political landscape is for women to progress in politics there must be grants, there must be maternity, there must be benefits, there must be all the supports necessary that already exist in public life or in private corporate life must be in public life as well and also the issue around social media and cyber bullying which is a serious problem particularly for women and that they're protected in that. And finally then we said our third point would be accountability from the top board and down to through the organizations again in private and public life.",
        "CHAIR: Thank you very much breakout group three it's interesting to see the way certain themes are coming through from each group and then where there are differences between each group as well so let's hear next from breakout group four please.",
        "BREAKOUT GROUP 4: Yeah so we've much the similar points actually from as the other three groups so yeah so our first point that we wanted to bring was quotas so we said that we'd have a quota of 40-60 with an aim as to having 50-50 like as like not aspirational but having a minimum quota as 40-60 but alongside that it couldn't work in just as like just throwing in a quota that it would have to be alongside the supports of child care for both women and men going into politics to make politics more gender more accessible to everyone as such as well as like parties being would be penalized if they weren't obeying just they are helping the candidates that they put forward. Another point that we came up with was we wanted to phase out the funding of single gender schools just to make like just to start from the ground up as well as the quotas on the top like leadership positions in politics. And our third suggestion that we wanted to bring forward is along with education as well so I know a few of the other speakers have already spoken about education but we wanted education from on a schools level to include civic engagement and like being an active member in society from like primary school level up as well as role models training and mentorship programs. And funding in like at the community level organizations separate from sporting organizations that would encourage more training and development of all members of society so just even like boys and girls should be for everyone to be a more active member of society in the hope that we'd get rid of like stereotypes and make it normal for I don't know for it won't be such like a boy's elitist club of politics in the end and like and in leadership positions that everyone has the opportunity to reach the top as such so yeah there were three recommendations.",
        "CHAIR: Thank you very much I think it's an interesting idea to encourage everybody to participate in society more broadly from an early age that would be great if that could happen. Next I come to group five and the rapporteur there is breakout group five.",
        "BREAKOUT GROUP 5: In our group there was a very clear agreement that there is a need for change accelerated disruptive change to the system we were all very inspired by the last Australian video and just the attitude in it. That gender inequality is a symptom of organizational deficiency and needs to be addressed by men and women. Quotas was we there was very clear agreement that we need quotas at national and local government level and in all public bodies. Quotas need to be measurable, transparent, accountable, measurable targets on gender equality and the meeting of those targets is linked to funding. We would like to see a Minister for gender inequality or for gender equality rather yes a minister for gender equality specifically with responsibility for developing a strategic plan in all sectors to develop a systemic change and things that basic things that would come under that were like parental leave, maternity leave for public representatives we felt it was just beyond belief that that doesn't exist, the gender pay gap and cyber accountability on how women are represented or how young people are targeted all of that would come under that. And our third one was education and awareness. So awareness raising for everybody on the cultural and historical gender bias and how we have got to where we are. And for education to become gender neutral with gender neutral career guidance with education from an early age on politics and leadership.",
        "CHAIR: That's great thank you very much again it's interesting to see where views are converging and where they're being elaborated in a different way this is a very rich harvest I think. Breakout group number six please.",
        "BREAKOUT GROUP 6: Hi so similar to everybody else I don't think this is going to surprise anybody our group had sort of we grouped into three main ways removal of barriers, education and advertising. So looking at removal of barriers we also looked at the quota concerns or the quota issue and we felt that if quotas were more directly related back to the funding and there was that they had to publish their funding figures or they had to publish how they were using it that if it was linked more to equality and to spreading that out equally there would be a better shape on that. We felt strongly about the maternity issue this is particularly moving barriers now into politics into the maternity leave issue but we also felt that it needed to be more of an equal split and there's no reason that maternity can't be split fairly evenly amongst partners whatever that partnership looks like so we felt that. And then into this as well was the pay at the gender gap for the pay gap and to try and close that down. I suppose a bit like everybody else we felt that education was very important and coming in early and young and if we bring the political and the gender equality in together we felt that if there was an earlier practical engagement with younger kids probably primary school age and there was a strong curriculum change there to bring civic citizenship together and to bring that to the fore with some sort of mentoring and sponsorship support. We felt something like a signature project something like young scientist or Gaisce to really kind of get people thinking and working together but we felt that it would engage politics at a local level at a younger age group in society to try and get people engaged in community politics and country politics at a much earlier age and that would then bring through some strong gender balance and some gender equality so we felt strongly about that. And finally we felt that so much of this is rooted in how media portrays gender how media portrays gender roles and we recognize that a lot has been done there but when we look at social media and how people are how people are attacked on public media how they're portrayed on public media that is definitely a huge barrier and whilst there are so many negative aspects to it they could be very easily turned positive particularly if there was a strong awareness campaign and if that was led by government that that would start to build awareness, challenge ideas, normalize and then also that will build momentum to create that pressure to build that pressure to create that change. And looking back at that Australian video it should all build together really and force that change along so there are three main categories.",
        "CHAIR: Thank you very much what I think is fascinating is the strong teams that are emerging from every group but the fact that every group had a slightly different contribution to make at the same time I think that's really enriching the whole process. Let's move on next to group number seven.",
        "BREAKOUT GROUP 7: The recommendations from breakout room seven and again a lot of overlap with us. Education we've thought was probably very key in this the earlier the better you start we're going all the way up through sport as well that we feel the supports aren't there we would recommend genderless schooling so doing a way of girls and skirts versus boys and trousers more mixed schools that there is more of an option there rather than the single sex schools. And again to bring that through to sporting not to be segregating them off there's no reason that children can't train together and use each other as role models and learn together and that will then just bring everyone cohesively together more naturally so we thought from preschool years upwards that there should be a good focus on this but should it carry through into his college years. Our second point was we feel there should be free available child care for all full paid parental leave and available to all parents’ guardians whatever the family dynamic looks like. We think that's a huge barrier to both genders but obviously disproportionately women as well. And thirdly onto the kind of harsher penalties for verbal and electronic abuse to enforce the laws that are already in place that we have legislation there we have laws in place and that there's a bigger accountability and a punishment and they're it's enforced better.",
        "CHAIR: Thank you very much breakout group seven that's great. Next I come then to group eight.",
        "BREAKOUT GROUP 8: So this will come as no surprise to anyone on public life our group felt very strongly about quotas and that in order to be meaningful gender quotas should be applied in local elections and senate elections as well as in general elections. There was also a strong push for maternity leave to be available for politicians and that some sort of process should be in place for the selection of a delegate for the duration of the maternity leave and that remote working should also be made available as an option. In industry we found the male champion for change video from Australia very interesting and we thought that initiatives like that would go down very well in Ireland alongside perhaps some training to remove unconscious bias. And then we were also very interested in the experience and of minorities and in all aspects of life from public life to sport to industry and we would like to see what barriers are there specifically for minorities for their engagement and what can be done to overcome those barriers and engage more in participation.",

        "MR ALLEN: You are then part of the Liaison Committee superstructure, which will allow you to have a debate on the Floor if there are persistent Departments who do not answer petitioners and do not answer the House in particular. You will have that authority, that power, and I am sure the Speaker would take a very dim view if departments did not come forward with a proper answer, so you would get Adjournment debates, you would get preference of questions.",

        "MR NUTTALL: Can I just explore a little bit more: it seems to me, as I say, we can have the debate about whether it is a good idea or not to have e-petitions. We are there and it is going to happen. All we are really looking at is the mechanics of how we go about it and it seems to me that one of the problems with the existing system is the lack of explanation to the public as to what they can reasonably expect from that. It is about managing expectations really, and I just wondered about what your views were as to what we can do from the outset with the members of the public who engage with the system and say, 'I want to petition because I have this problem' to be realistic with them, to say, 'Okay, good' but—and sorry to use the word 'but' early on in the system, but I think we have to—about honesty really on the website and I was just wondering what your views were.",
        "NATASCHA ENGEL: I think if you have a system whereby you do have a gateway where there is a human being at the other end of the phone, a clerk who kind of takes you through what the options are and explores what it is that you as a petitioner are trying to achieve, then at that point, your expectations are managed. At the moment, when it reaches 100,000 signatures, the perception is that once it goes, 'Bing, 100,000' there is a debate, a vote and a change in the law immediately and of course that does not happen."

Obviously, digitisation is very good for access in certain circumstances, but we need to think about how people who are digitally excluded for a range of reasons, which can include poverty, disability and other factors, will access GRCs. It is important to think about what the non-digital pathway looks like. I am a great fan of the Government Digital Service. I trust the Government to make a perfectly sensible piece of software. The key opportunity is to strip out some of the bureaucracy that has developed around the process and the panel, go back to the Gender Recognition Act as it is and ask what is strictly required on the face of the Act. Just digitising a process that is incredibly bureaucratic, overwhelming in the buckets of documents required, intrusive, and dysfunctional in all the ways that we have described does not do that much to improve. If, when you digitise, you look at the scope creep of the panel and the ways in which we have created a bit of a monster around the Gender Recognition Act, and ask, 'What here can we strip back without resort to legislative changes?', digitisation will offer some real benefits.",

        "ALEX DAVIES-JONES: I have been doing some work with Jo’s Cervical Cancer Trust on the importance of inclusive language in healthcare, particularly when it comes to trans men and ensuring that they get access to what they need. How well are under-18s who want to transition currently supported by the Government and the NHS? What more can we do to support trans children?",
        "LUI ASQUITH: Thank you for raising this issue. Every single day at Mermaids, we hear about the anxiety and distress that is being produced through an unfortunately delayed and untimely healthcare system. First, I would like to say very clearly that we recognise and are very grateful for the hard work of NHS workers, not only within the pathways that focus on trans healthcare, but outside of that, and certainly reflecting on the past 12 months. We want to recognise that. However, the current system is simply not providing trans people with the support that they need in a timely and accessible way. We see the real human impact of that every single day. I speak directly with parents. It is difficult to find the vocabulary for what we hear, in all honesty. You can imagine the love of a parent for a child. In the reality of a young person not getting the support they need in a timely way, where does someone go? This is the question that is being asked. In a broader answer to your question, there is not enough. There is not enough resource. We can see that from the waiting times that have already been alluded to in this session and the personal testimony that is coming through. One huge message I want to give, and a plea to the Committee members here today, is that there are so many trans, non-binary and gender-diverse young people who are subject to the current health system and want to talk to people like you. If you are interested in speaking to young people directly, please do reach out. I want to say that. Generally, we need to look more to primary healthcare, GP access, decentralising the process or diversifying it, whichever way you want to put it. Diversify healthcare to allow for more timely, accessible support. We are making the really important point that not every young person requires medical intervention. I want to make this point really clearly, because the dialogue that is out in wider society right now would lead any reasonable individual to think that every young person goes on to require medical intervention. The vast majority of young people simply require emotional support, which leads me to my final point before I hand over the mic. Mental health support needs to get so much better. I have to say that there is not really anything out there right now, certainly for trans, non-binary and gender-diverse young people, and certainly in terms of accessible and timely support. We need to train up our healthcare professionals to ensure that they are empowered to deliver a fantastic service to all young people, including trans, non-binary and gender-variant young people.",
        "NANCY KELLEY: Stonewall completely supports everything that Lui has just said. Our positions are really closely aligned with Mermaids as partners, so I will not repeat it because that would be a waste of time. I just wanted to make a couple of points about the lack of guidance that supports social transition. What Lui just said is incredibly important when we talk about trans and non-binary children and young people. The public conversation focuses almost exclusively on the very small minority who go on to receive endocrine services while they are still minors. The vast majority of trans and non-binary children do not always receive the social support that they require. The key thing that I wanted to point to here is that there is a complete absence of guidance to schools about how they should support and include trans children and young people. In fact, the only guidance that currently exists from DfE tells you what you are not supposed to do; it does not tell you what you are supposed to do as a teacher when you have a trans child in your class. There is a huge gap around how you do trans inclusion positively in school to support those children and young people. Aligned with this, we are really keen to make sure that the Government supports a great implementation of LGBT-inclusive relationships and sex education. As part of that, children and young people can start to learn about trans identities as well as LGB identities within the classroom. From all of our work with teachers who are trying to support LGBT children and young people in classrooms, teachers and headteachers are absolutely desperate for great tools to support trans children and young people in their setting. The Government could do much more to give positive guidance around supporting trans and non-binary children and young people to thrive in their day-to-day lives.",
        "CAT BURTON: I absolutely support Lui in every single thing they said. Non-timely intervention for trans young people can be a lifelong tragedy. I just want to say that, yes, the vast majority just need socialisation, support and talk. But, at Tanner stage 2, there is a very limited window of opportunity to prevent long-term damage from inappropriate puberty.",
        "BEN BRADLEY: That is where puberty blockers are essential, and those puberty blockers really need to be prescribed at the onset of Tanner stage 2. For those of you who do not know in detail what the Tanner stages are, Tanner stage 2 is the first visible sign of puberty. If you do not intervene then, the young person very quickly moves on to later Tanner stages. Particularly for a young woman who is suddenly getting a flood of testosterone, some of those changes are very difficult to correct in later life. Most notably, the voice breaks, and there is very little one can do about a voice that is broken other than an awful lot of hard work. Facial hair arrives. I had 147 hours of electrolysis, and I really do not want anybody to know what that felt like. All of that was because of damage caused by testosterone during puberty. That timely intervention cannot currently be given because of waiting lists. I hope we are going to get the opportunity to talk about medical pathways in much more detail later on in the session, because there are better ways for it to be done than simply having a single clinic with a huge waiting list. Money is not the solution.",
        "LUI ASQUITH: The increase in numbers should not shock us objectively. If we look at the figures, an estimate is that around 1% of the population may be trans. If we take that and plonk it in the population of young people, we are talking about thousands and thousands of young people who are statistically expected perhaps to be under that umbrella of trans. When you take the context of the numbers, certainly relating to the Tavistock, within that context, it suddenly becomes more understandable. As a society, we should take the increase in numbers as a success story, in that it is likely to mean that we are creating a culture whereby people can come out. People feel empowered to say, “This is who I am, and I would like some support for that.” How is that ever going to be a bad thing? In respect of the figures you brought up there, in relation to people who are assigned female at birth, interestingly, there is currently a higher percentage of individuals who were assigned female. Not so long ago, the trend was that there was a higher proportion of assigned-male individuals. It will be interesting to see how that looks in future. Simply, we can look at the data. We can look at statistics, but it is important to remember the individual and the young person at the heart of it. It is about saying, “The data and the numbers can be X at any given time,” but what we have to come back to is that we know that trans, non-binary and gender-variant young people exist. We know that some of them require healthcare support and we need to provide a system that offers the support that those individuals need at any one time.",
        "KATE OSBORNE: Hello to all the panel. Thank you so much for your evidence so far. It is really helpful. I am going to focus on the Government’s response to the GRA consultation. All of my questions are to all of you. First of all, did the Government ask the right questions during the consultation? If not, what would you have liked them to have included?",
        "NANCY KELLEY: I will try to be uncharacteristically brief. Broadly, the Government did ask the right questions. They should have focused also on non-binary inclusion, as I have indicated, and on minors. In general, as a consultation, the problem was not the questions. The problem was that the consultation remained open for such an extraordinary length of time, which allowed a lot of anti-trans mobilisation to happen, and that the Government, most importantly, then did not respond to their own consultation. All of the things that we have been talking about today, in terms of de-medicalising the process, having a simple statutory declaration and removing spousal veto, were supported by the public when they responded to the consultation. From our perspective, there are some things that could definitely have been improved about the questions, but the primary issue was not the questions. It was the failure to act and respond to the answers the Government got.",
        "KATE OSBORNE: Nancy, you touched on this. The Government opened the consultation in 2018 and responded in 2020. Let us know your view of the time taken for the Government to respond. What else, if anything, should the Government have included in their proposed changes, and why?",
        "NANCY KELLEY: There was no reason to leave the consultation open as long as they did. It meant that there was a lot of really frenetic anti-trans organising. There was a flourishing within our media, which is famous around the world now for being transphobic, which is incredibly sad, of really persistent anti-trans narratives. That then made it incredibly difficult to act on the results of the consultation. Many of the things that the public asked for in their responses are the things that we would have wanted to see. We have ended up with some valuable but minor changes to the scope of gender recognition, when we could have stepped back into the space of being among some of the leading nations internationally with simple, dignified processes of self-declaration. The Government had the mandate for doing that in the responses to their consultation. It is just unclear to us why they did not take that political leadership at that time. There are still things that can be done within the scope of non-legislative GRA reform that we would really recommend the Government use this opportunity to do: setting a clear timescale; moving on in a really positive way around digitisation; removing the fees; but also, really importantly, streamlining the medical and panel components of this process, which are not all required on the face of the current Act. We would see it as an enormous shame if the Government firstly ignored the responses to their own consultation, and then proceeded not to take all of the opportunities they could take without legislation to make this process more appropriate, more dignified and more supportive of trans communities.",
        "CAT BURTON: Nancy has put it in a nutshell. The problem with the consultation was that, when it closed, nothing else happened.",
        "DR HAMLIN: There were over 100,000 valid responses, so it was appropriate that the Government would take some time if they were going to consider them carefully. However, I was very disappointed about the time they did take to respond, particularly when that response demonstrated an ignorance of the bulk of the evidence submitted. I am grateful to you on this Committee for keeping the consultation alive and I really hope it is not going to be another waste of everybody’s time. Are all those 100,000 responses, all the thought that went into it and all the time that people spent invalid? Have they gone to waste? We have been through it all before. As has already been alluded to, people who were hostile to the rights of trans people submitted prepopulated questionnaires. Only 1% of the respondents had submitted an application or had one granted. In spite of that, a vast number of responses from the public were incredibly supportive of what we wanted: getting rid of the bureaucracy, getting rid of the intrusive medical statements and so on. I hope that, when you eventually question the Minister, you will do it rigorously on why all these responses were rejected and all these people’s efforts were thrown on the scrapheap in such a cavalier manner.",
        "LUI ASQUITH: Conversation and respectful debate are massively important, but what we saw within that interim period was a dangerous move to questioning the existence of trans people within this country. We saw that play out mainly, as Nancy referred to, within the media. No doubt, this delay in response contributed to that continuing and snowballing throughout that period of time. There was no unequivocal message from Government to say, 'This is where we stand. We include trans people and we will not tolerate intolerance.' The delay added fuel to the confusion, which we referred to earlier, between the Equality Act and the Gender Recognition Act. Incorrect information was put out. At the time, it added to the idea that this erroneous information was correct. That was a huge problem. Just to make a bullet-point note of what our service users were incredibly disappointed at not seeing in the response, there was no under-18 recognition, non-binary recognition, de-medicalisation or eradication of the two-year real-life experience test.",
        "KATE OSBORNE: What should the proposed nominal fee be for the GRC? Should a fee, indeed, exist at all?",
        "NANCY KELLEY: Our preference would be nothing. If it has to be a fee, it should be the lowest possible fee so as to create no barriers to people in accessing a GRC.",
        "CAT BURTON: The main reason why the fee is set high is because of the degree of bureaucracy and the fact that there is a panel of learned judges. If you take the complication away, the fee can go too.",
        "KATE OSBORNE: Jane, in your written evidence, you argue that the fee is not a key issue, but both the National LGBT Survey and the GRA consultation state that the fee is a barrier to many. At the same time as giving us your views on the fee and whether there should be one, could you maybe expand on your view of it not being a key issue?",
        "DR HAMLIN: The fee obviously is an issue, but it is not a key issue because all the other issues we have been discussing this afternoon are far more important. We are not clear what the purpose of the fee is. If it were absolutely clear, perhaps we would be happier about it. As Cat has just said, if the whole system were simplified and we got rid of all the bureaucracy, there would not need to be a fee, except perhaps a notional fee. If it were a notional fee, it would probably cost more to collect than it would bring in. That is what I mean, really. It is not that the fee is not an issue; it is just a minor one compared with all the other ones that are much more important to us. It is not because we are wealthy or anything.",
        "LUI ASQUITH: I have nothing much more to add. I would just simply suggest that, in the recommended system that we put forward, the fee would not have to be any higher than the cost of a new birth certificate. I echo Nancy’s point that there should be an opportunity for a fee waiver for those who cannot afford that.",
        "KATE OSBORNE: Earlier on, Nancy and Cat both touched on this around digitisation. What key changes would you like the Government to make when digitising the GRC application process? Do you have any concerns about it going online at all?"

        "SPEAKER: Judge, the suggestion is that the word \"relevant\" be removed and include \"Minister for State at the Department of Health\"?",
        "MS. CLIFF: The only issue with that is there is more than one Minister of State at the Department of Health and the title can change. So like where we had the Minister for State for Older Persons it has now become Mental Health and Older Persons. So from a Government programme to a Government programme, the number of Ministers of State can change and the title can change as well.",
        "MS. RICKARD-CLARKE: And also I would add that the Department of Social Protection have a huge responsibility in relation to older people and the whole question of financial pension and abuse is a huge responsibility at the moment. This year 7.2 billion is paid out to our 600 over 66 people. A high level of financial abuse. So I would say the Department of Social Protection has a huge responsibility.",
        "MS. FINEGAN: And just to further supplement that. Oftentimes a Minister of State will straddle more than one Department and it's arguable that perhaps in relation to older people that there are arguments in favour of why that might be--",
        "MS. RICKARD-CLARKE: And housing for older people and you know the whole question of well-being of older people. It's not just a health issue. So healthy older people also need, somebody needs to have responsibility to make sure they live well.",
        "MR. O'SHEA: Could I just add one point to that. I think there is great merit in having a specificity for that Minister of State for older people, solely for older people, given the cross-cutting element of that and you know I think if you want to emphasise the importance of older people then I think it might be useful to focus the Minister of State only on older people because of so much cross-cutting because it's not at the moment.",
        "CHAIRPERSON: Unless we said devolved and I'm wondering should it be delegated. The Minister of State for Older People. Would that help?",
        "SPEAKER: Devolved to a dedicated Minister.",
        "MS. FINEGAN: So the suggestion from the floor is devolved to a dedicated Minister of State.",
        "SPEAKER: Were we not told yesterday that there's a specific reform in the-- that the relevant Minister has to devolve the responsibility down to the Minister for State so that he has that responsibility. So devolved is the word that's required here rather than any other word?",
        "MS. FINEGAN: Well actually we've--",
        "CHAIRPERSON: We've looked up the Act and it's delegated. It was originally the Ministers and Secretaries Act of 1924 believe it or not. It's now the Ministers and Secretaries Amendment Number 2 Act 1977 and what it says in the first subsection is \"it shall be lawful for the Government by order made on the request of a Minister of the Government to delegate to a Minister of State assigned to the Department of State of which the Minister of the Government has charge, all powers and duties of such Minister of the Government under any particular Act or any particular statutory power or duty of such a Minister of the Government.\"",
        "MS. FINEGAN: It's catchy! So yes, the word is delegated. So as we are currently discussing I think the construct would be \"the responsibility for older people should be formally delegated to a dedicated Minister of State for older people.\""
